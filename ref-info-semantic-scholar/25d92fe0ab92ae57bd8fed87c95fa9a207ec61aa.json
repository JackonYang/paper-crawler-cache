The input image is first decomposed into a set of subbands at multiple scales and orientations using near-orthogonal symmetric quadrature mirror filters. This is followed by a nonlinear \u201cdivisive normalization\u201d stage, in which each linear coefficient is divided by a value computed from a small set of neighboring coefficients in space, orientation and scale. This neighborhood is chosen to allow this nonlinear operation to be efficiently inverted. The parameters of the normalization operation are optimized in order to maximize the independence of the normalized responses for natural images. We demonstrate the near-independence of these nonlinear responses, and suggest a number of applications for which this representation should be well suited."

The success of such a system depends on two properties of the representation. First, the coding rate is minimized only if the elements of the representation are statistically independent. Second, the perceived coding distortion is minimized only if the errors in a reconstructed image arising from quantization of the different elements of the representation are perceptually independent. We argue that linear transforms cannot achieve either of these goals and propose, instead, an adaptive nonlinear image representation in which each coefficient of a linear transform is divided by a weighted sum of coefficient amplitudes in a generalized neighborhood. We then show that the divisive operation greatly reduces both the statistical and the perceptual redundancy amongst representation elements. We develop an efficient method of inverting this transformation, and we demonstrate through simulations that the dual reduction in dependency can greatly improve the visual quality of compressed images."

The representation is a non-linear generalization of the Laplacian pyramid and is tuned to the type of scale invariance exhibited by natural imagery as opposed to other scale invariant images such as 1/f correlated noise and the step edge. The transformation of an image to a higher order pyramid is simple to compute and straightforward to invert. Because the representation is invertible it is shown that the higher order pyramid can be truncated and quantized with little loss of visual quality. Images coded in this representation have much less redundancy than the raw image pixels and decorrelating transformations such as the Laplacian pyramid. This is demonstrated by showing statistical independence between pairs of coefficients. Because the representation is tuned to the ensemble redundancies the coefficients of the higher order pyramid are more efficient at capturing the variation within the ensemble which leads too improved matching results. This is demonstrated on two recognition tasks, face recognition with illumination changes and object recognition which viewpoint changes."

The image signal is decomposed via even and odd symmetric frequency and orientation selective bandpass filters in analogy to the quadrature phase simple cell pairs in the visual cortex. The resulting analytic signal is transformed into a local amplitude and local phase representation in order to achieve a better match to its signal statistics. Both intra filter dependencies of the analytic signal and inter filter dependencies between different orientation filters are exploited by a suitable vector quantization scheme. Inter orientation filter dependencies are demonstrated by means of a statistical evaluation of the multidimensional probability density function. The results can be seen as an empirical confirmation of the suitability of vector quantization in subband coding. Instead of generating a code book by use of an conventional designalgorithm we suggest a feature specific partitioning of the multidimensional signal space matched to the properties of human vision. Using this coding scheme satisfactory image quality can be obtained with about 0. 78 bit/pixel."

A log intensity image is first decomposed into a set of subbands at multiple scales and orientations. Operating successively from coarse frequency bands to fine, the coefficients of each subband are adjusted so as to move their locally averaged amplitudes toward a target value using a gamma operation. Target values are chosen to fall linearly over scale, consistent with a scale-invariant spectral model. To avoid enlarging the range of image intensity values, in those locations where the local mean is near the minimal or maximal values of the image and the local contrast is being boosted significantly, the local mean is moved toward the global mean. Finally, a spatial mask is applied in the pixel domain to ensure that the enhancements are applied only in the vicinity of image features. The resulting image appears to be both sharper and of higher contrast."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

We estimate the gain in statistical independence (the multi-information reduction) achieved with independent component analysis (ICA), principal component analysis (PCA), zero-phase whitening, and predictive coding. Predictive coding is translated into the transform coding framework, where it can be characterized by the constraint of a triangular filter matrix. A randomly sampled whitening basis and the Haar wavelet are included in the comparison as well. The comparison of all these methods is carried out for different patch sizes, ranging from 2x2 to 16x16 pixels. In spite of large differences in the shape of the basis functions, we find only small differences in the multi-information between all decorrelation transforms (5% or less) for all patch sizes. Among the second-order methods, PCA is optimal for small patch sizes and predictive coding performs best for large patch sizes. The extra gain achieved with ICA is always less than 2%. In conclusion, the edge filters found with ICA lead to only a surprisingly small improvement in terms of its actual objective."

Pairs of wavelet coefficients, corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales, are found to be non-Gaussian in both their marginal and joint statistical properties. Specifically, their marginals are heavy-tailed, and although they are typically decorrelated, their magnitudes are highly correlated. We propose a Markov model that explains these dependencies using a linear predictor for magnitude coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, and show that it accounts for the statistics of a wide variety of images including photographic images, graphical images, and medical images. In order to directly demonstrate the power of the model, we construct an image coder called EPWIC (embedded predictive wavelet image coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bitplane at a time using a nonadaptive arithmetic encoder that utilizes conditional probabilities calculated from the model. Bitplanes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit. The decoder uses the statistical model to predict coefficient values based on the bits it has received. Despite the simplicity of the model, the rate-distortion performance of the coder is roughly comparable to the best image coders in the literature."

We show that this decomposition, with parameters optimized for the statistics of a generic ensemble of natural images or sounds, provides a good characterization of the nonlinear response properties of typical neurons in primary visual cortex or auditory nerve, respectively. These results suggest that nonlinear response properties of sensory neurons are not an accident of biological implementation, but have an important functional role."

Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online at http://www.cns.nyu.edu//spl sim/lcv/ssim/."

The approach extends traditional Markov random field (MRF) models by learning potential functions over extended pixel neighborhoods. Field potentials are modeled using a Products-of-Experts framework that exploits nonlinear functions of many linear filter responses. In contrast to previous MRF approaches all parameters, including the linear filters themselves, are learned from training data. We demonstrate the capabilities of this Field of Experts model with two example applications, image denoising and image inpainting, which are implemented using a simple, approximate inference scheme. While the model is trained on a generic image database and is not tuned toward a specific application, we obtain results that compete with and even outperform specialized techniques."

                "text": "Many low-level vision algorithms assume a prior probability over images, and there has been great interest in trying to learn this prior from examples. Since images are very non Gaussian, high dimensional, continuous signals, learning their distribution presents a tremendous computational challenge. Perhaps the most successful recent algorithm is the Fields of Experts (FOE) [20] model which has shown impressive performance by modeling image statistics with a product of potentials defined on filter outputs. However, as in previous models of images based on filter outputs [30], calculating the probability of an image given the model requires evaluating an intractable partition function. This makes learning very slow (requires Monte-Carlo sampling at every step) and makes it virtually impossible to compare the likelihood of two different models. Given this computational difficulty, it is hard to say whether nonintu-itive features learned by such models represent a true property of natural images or an artifact of the approximations used during learning. In this paper we present (1) tractable lower and upper bounds on the partition function of models based on filter outputs and (2) efficient learning algorithms that do not require any sampling. Our results are based on recent results in machine learning that deal with Gaussian potentials. We extend these results to non-Gaussian potentials and derive a novel, basis rotation algorithm for approximating the maximum likelihood filters. Our results allow us to (1) rigorously compare the likelihood of different models and (2) calculate high likelihood models of natural image statistics in a matter of minutes. Applying our results to previous models shows that the nonintuitive features are not an artifact of the learning process but rather are capturing robust properties of natural images."

In contrast to the causal generative extensions of ICA which maintain marginal independence of sources, we define features as deterministic (linear) functions of the inputs. This assumption results in marginal dependencies among the features, but conditional independence of the features given the inputs. By assigning energies to the features a probability distribution over the input states is defined through the Boltzmann distribution. Free parameters of this model are trained using the contrastive divergence objective (Hinton, 2002). When the number of features is equal to the number of input dimensions this energy-based model reduces to noiseless ICA and we show experimentally that the proposed learning algorithm is able to perform blind source separation on speech data. In additional experiments we train overcomplete energy-based models to extract features from various standard data-sets containing speech, natural images, hand-written digits and faces."

In this paper, a modified version of the linear/energy model is presented in which striate cells mutually inhibit one another, effectively normalizing their responses with respect to stimulus contrast.

Various techniques have been proposed for compressing the dynamic range while retaining important visual information. Multi-scale image processing techniques, which are widely used for many image processing tasks, have a reputation of causing halo artifacts when used for range compression. However, we demonstrate that they can work when properly implemented. We use a symmetrical analysis-synthesis filter bank, and apply local gain control to the subbands. We also show that the technique can be adapted for the related problem of \"companding\", in which an HDR image is converted to an LDR image, and later expanded back to high dynamic range."

By limiting the generality of the matrices considered, the essential ideas and results can be conveyed in a more intuitive manner without the mathematical machinery required for the most general cases. As an application the results are applied to the study of the covariance matrices and their factors of linear models of discrete time random processes."
