                "text": "We present two improvements to the well-known Recurrent Neural Network Language Models(RNNLM). First, we use the word embedding matrix to project the RNN output onto the output space and already achieve a large reduction in the number of free parameters while still improving performance. Second, instead of merely minimizing the standard cross entropy loss between the prediction distribution and the \u201done-hot\u201d target distribution, we minimize an additional loss term which takes into account the inherent metric similarity between the target word and other words. We show with experiments on the Penn Treebank Dataset that our proposed model (1) achieves significantly lower average word perplexity than previous models with the same network size and (2) achieves the new state of the art by using much fewer parameters than used in the previous best work. 1 Background & Introduction Language Modeling, which is the task of determining the probability that a sequence of words occur in a sentence, is an important task in Natural Language Processing(NLP). Its scope includes a large variety of tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, part of speech tagging, and spelling correction [1]. Old statistical approaches for addressing this problem were based on n-grams and their associated properties. Although these methods seemed to work reasonably well, they needed a larger value of n in order to capture a better model for the language, and they needed a number of parameters exponential in the size of the vocabulary [2]. Researchers have proposed methods to improve these models [1]; nonetheless, they are still difficult to implement in practice. Recently, with the advances in neural network research and the increased availability of faster computers, neural networks have started to replace the old methods for capturing the language structure. Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) were first proposed in [3] for addressing the language modelling task and attained a reasonably satisfactory performance. The follow-up work [4] improved the result by applying back-propagation in addition to the existing forward-propagation. In [5], Zaremba et. al. used Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) which were fist introduced in [6], as the building block of their recurrent neural network for language modelling. Furthermore, the authors showed that appropriat application of dropout may avoid overfitting and lead to a better and more generalizable model. The authors were further able to achieve the state of the art for language modeling on the Penn Dataset Treebank corpus[7]. In particular, by training a two-layer LSTM Recurrent Neural Network with 1500 hidden states and appropriate dropout, they could reduce the test perplexity to 78.4 for a single model. However, Recurrent Neural Network Language Models need big models for proper training (2 RNN layers with 1500 hidden units in each in [5]). In addition, their performance rely on training two very large matrices, one for word embeddings and one for output projection, both of which essentially capture the same thing: projection from token space to word vector space and vice versa. In this paper we explain how imposing this structure may help us to achieve a much better accuracy even on smaller networks. We also propose a novel method for augmenting the loss function with ad additional term which utilizes the similarity between words captured in word embeddings."

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition."

Our model employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a highway net work over characters, whose output is given to a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network language model (RNN-LM). On the English Penn Treebank the model is on par with the existing state-of-the-art despite having 60% fewer parameters. On languages with rich morphology (Arabic, Czech, French, German, Spanish, Russian), the model outperforms word-level/morpheme-level LSTM baselines, again with fewer parameters. The results suggest that on many languages, character inputs are sufficient for language modeling. Analysis of word representations obtained from the character composition part of the model reveals that the model is able to encode, from characters only, both semantic and orthographic information.\n \n"

Even then they struggle to predict rare or unseen words even if the context makes the prediction unambiguous. We introduce the pointer sentinel mixture architecture for neural sequence models which has the ability to either reproduce a word from the recent context or produce a word from a standard softmax classifier. Our pointer sentinel-LSTM model achieves state of the art language modeling performance on the Penn Treebank (70.9 perplexity) while using far fewer parameters than a standard softmax LSTM. In order to evaluate how well language models can exploit longer contexts and deal with more realistic vocabularies and larger corpora we also introduce the freely available WikiText corpus."

                "text": "A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80% up to 85.4%. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7%, an improvement of 9.7% over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases."

Notable examples of such architectures include gated recurrent units (GRU) and highway networks. In this work, we first focus on the evaluation of each of the classical gated architectures for language modeling for large vocabulary speech recognition. Namely, we evaluate the highway network, lateral network, LSTM and GRU. Furthermore, the motivation underlying the highway network also applies to LSTM and GRU. An extension specific to the LSTM has been recently proposed with an additional highway connection between the memory cells of adjacent LSTM layers. In contrast, we investigate an approach which can be used with both LSTM and GRU: a highway network in which the LSTM or GRU is used as the transformation function. We found that the highway connections enable both standalone feedforward and recurrent neural language models to benefit better from the deep structure and provide a slight improvement of recognition accuracy after interpolation with count models. To complete the overview, we include our initial investigations on the use of the attention mechanism for learning word triggers."

Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

However, recurrent neural networks with 'deep' transition functions remain difficult to train, even when using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. We introduce a novel theoretical analysis of recurrent networks based on Gersgorin's circle theorem that illuminates several modeling and optimization issues and improves our understanding of the LSTM cell. Based on this analysis we propose Recurrent Highway Networks, which extend the LSTM architecture to allow step-to-step transition depths larger than one. Several language modeling experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture results in powerful and efficient models. On the Penn Treebank corpus, solely increasing the transition depth from 1 to 10 improves word-level perplexity from 90.6 to 65.4 using the same number of parameters. On the larger Wikipedia datasets for character prediction (text8 and enwik8), RHNs outperform all previous results and achieve an entropy of 1.27 bits per character."

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible."

This is made possible by having a single attention mechanism that is shared across all language pairs. We train the proposed multi-way, multilingual model on ten language pairs from WMT'15 simultaneously and observe clear performance improvements over models trained on only one language pair.

An SPN consists of interleaving layers of sum nodes and product nodes. A sum node can be interpreted as a hidden variable, and a product node can be viewed as a feature capturing rich interactions among an SPN\u2019s inputs. We show that the ability of SPN to use hidden layers to model complex dependencies among words, and its tractable inference and learning times, make it a suitable framework for a language model. Even though SPNs have been applied to a variety of vision problems [1, 2], we are the first to use it for language modeling. Our empirical comparisons with six previous language models indicate that our SPN has superior performance."

We propose three new probabilistic language models that define the distribution of the next word in a sequence given several preceding words by using distributed representations of those words. We show how real-valued distributed representations for words can be learned at the same time as learning a large set of stochastic binary hidden features that are used to predict the distributed representation of the next word from previous distributed representations. Adding connections from the previous states of the binary hidden features improves performance as does adding direct connections between the real-valued distributed representations. One of our models significantly outperforms the very best n-gram models."

In this work, we propose a fully data-driven approach to abstractive sentence summarization. Our method utilizes a local attention-based model that generates each word of the summary conditioned on the input sentence. While the model is structurally simple, it can easily be trained end-to-end and scales to a large amount of training data. The model shows significant performance gains on the DUC-2004 shared task compared with several strong baselines."

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel."

Yet a major difficulty with these models is their tendency to overfit, with dropout shown to fail when applied to recurrent layers. Recent results at the intersection of Bayesian modelling and deep learning offer a Bayesian interpretation of common deep learning techniques such as dropout. This grounding of dropout in approximate Bayesian inference suggests an extension of the theoretical results, offering insights into the use of dropout with RNN models. We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU models, assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks. The new approach outperforms existing techniques, and to the best of our knowledge improves on the single model state-of-the-art in language modelling with the Penn Treebank (73.4 test perplexity). This extends our arsenal of variational tools in deep learning."

The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically."

We start by arguing that the concept of depth in an RNN is not as clear as it is in feedforward neural networks. By carefully analyzing and understanding the architecture of an RNN, however, we find three points of an RNN which may be made deeper; (1) input-to-hidden function, (2) hidden-to-hidden transition and (3) hidden-to-output function. Based on this observation, we propose two novel architectures of a deep RNN which are orthogonal to an earlier attempt of stacking multiple recurrent layers to build a deep RNN (Schmidhuber, 1992; El Hihi and Bengio, 1996). We provide an alternative interpretation of these deep RNNs using a novel framework based on neural operators. The proposed deep RNNs are empirically evaluated on the tasks of polyphonic music prediction and language modeling. The experimental result supports our claim that the proposed deep RNNs benefit from the depth and outperform the conventional, shallow RNNs."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

In this paper we develop a loss function for multi-label learning, based on the Wasserstein distance. The Wasserstein distance provides a natural notion of dissimilarity for probability measures. Although optimizing with respect to the exact Wasserstein distance is costly, recent work has described a regularized approximation that is efficiently computed. We describe an efficient learning algorithm based on this regularization, as well as a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures. We also describe a statistical learning bound for the loss. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space. We demonstrate this property on a real-data tag prediction problem, using the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons dataset, outperforming a baseline that doesn't use the metric."

In this work, we introduce Neural Process Networks to understand procedural text through (neural) simulation of action dynamics. Our model complements existing memory architectures with dynamic entity tracking by explicitly modeling actions as state transformers. The model updates the states of the entities by executing learned action operators. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed model can reason about the unstated causal effects of actions, allowing it to provide more accurate contextual information for understanding and generating procedural text, all while offering more interpretable internal representations than existing alternatives."

These transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification system."

Accurate numerical methods are developed for computing the principal angles $\\theta_k (F,G)$ and orthogonal sets of principal vectors $u_k\\ \\epsilon\\ F$ and $v_k\\ \\epsilon\\ G$, k = 1,2,..., q = dim(G) $\\leq$ dim(F). An important application in statistics is computing the canonical correlations $\\sigma_k\\ = cos \\theta_k$ between two sets of variates. A perturbation analysis shows that the condition number for $\\theta_k$ essentially is max($\\kappa (A),\\kappa (B)$), where $\\kappa$ denotes the condition number of a matrix. The algorithms are based on a preliminary QR-factorization of A and B (or $A^H$ and $B^H$), for which either the method of Householder transformations (HT) or the modified Gram-Schmidt method (MGS) is used. Then cos $\\theta_k$ and sin $\\theta_k$ are computed as the singular values of certain related matrices. Experimental results are given, which indicates that MGS gives $\\theta_k$ with equal precision and fewer arithmetic operations than HT. However, HT gives principal vectors, which are orthogonal to working accuracy, which is not in general true for MGS. Finally the case when A and/or B are rank deficient is discussed."
