The success is largely attributed to the use of local filtering and max-pooling in the CNN architecture. In this paper, we propose to apply CNN to speech recognition within the framework of hybrid NN-HMM model. We propose to use local filtering and max-pooling in frequency domain to normalize speaker variance to achieve higher multi-speaker speech recognition performance. In our method, a pair of local filtering layer and max-pooling layer is added at the lowest end of neural network (NN) to normalize spectral variations of speech signals. In our experiments, the proposed CNN architecture is evaluated in a speaker independent speech recognition task using the standard TIMIT data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN method can achieve over 10% relative error reduction in the core TIMIT test sets when comparing with a regular NN using the same number of hidden layers and weights. Our results also show that the best result of the proposed CNN model is better than previously published results on the same TIMIT test sets that use a pre-trained deep NN model."

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."

The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The SOM provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the SOM, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in place of the convolutional network for comparison. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We analyze the computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer."

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition."

An alternati ve way to evaluate the fit is to use a feedforward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients a s input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks with many hidden layers, that are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform Gaussian mixture models on a variety of speech rec ognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This paper provides an overview of this progress and repres nts the shared views of four research groups who have had recent successes in using deep neural networks for a coustic modeling in speech recognition."

Recently, an alternative structure was proposed which trains a NN with a constant number of hidden units to predict output targets, and then reduces the dimensionality of these output probabilities through an auto-encoder, to create auto-encoder bottleneck (AE-BN) features. The benefit of placing the BN after the posterior estimation network is that it avoids the loss in frame classification accuracy incurred by networks that place the BN before the softmax. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-training when creating AE-BN features. Our experiments indicate that with the AE-BN architecture, pre-trained and deeper NNs produce better AE-BN features. On a 50-hour English Broadcast News task, the AE-BN features provide over a 1% absolute improvement compared to a state-of-the-art GMM/HMM with a WER of 18.8% and pre-trained NN hybrid system with a WER of 18.4%. In addition, on a larger 430-hour Broadcast News task, AE-BN features provide a 0.5% absolute improvement over a strong GMM/HMM baseline with a WER of 16.0%. Finally, system combination with the GMM/HMM baseline and AE-BN systems provides an additional 0.5% absolute on 430 hours over the AE-BN system alone, yielding a final WER of 15.0%."

We describe a distributed neural network training algorithm, based on Hessianfree optimization, that scales to deep networks and large data sets. For the sMBR criterion, this training algorithm is faster than stochastic gradient descent by a factor of 5.5 and yields a 4.4% relative improvement in word error rate on a 50-hour broadcast news task. Distributed Hessian-free sMBR training yields relative reductions in word error rate of 7\u201313% over cross-entropy training with stochastic gradient descent on two larger tasks: Switchboard and DARPA RATS noisy Levantine Arabic.

In contrast, Gaussian mixture HMM systems are discriminatively trained using sequence-based criteria, such as minimum phone error or maximum mutual information, that are more directly related to speech recognition accuracy. This paper demonstrates that neural-network acoustic models can be trained with sequence classification criteria using exactly the same lattice-based methods that have been developed for Gaussian mixture HMMs, and that using a sequence classification criterion in training leads to considerably better performance. A neural network acoustic model with 153K weights trained on 50 hours of broadcast news has a word error rate of 34.0% on the rt04 English broadcast news test set. When this model is trained with the state-level minimum Bayes risk criterion, the rt04 word error rate is 27.7%."

They are competitive for three reasons: DBNs can be fine-tuned as neural networks; DBNs have many non-linear hidden layers; and DBNs are generatively pre-trained. This paper illustrates how each of these three aspects contributes to the DBN's good recognition performance using both phone recognition performance on the TIMIT corpus and a dimensionally reduced visualization of the relationships between the feature vectors learned by the DBNs that preserves the similarity structure of the feature vectors at multiple scales. The same two methods are also used to investigate the most suitable type of input representation for a DBN."

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second."
