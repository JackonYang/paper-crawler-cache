Inspired by various dual hybridizations being used, this paper proposes hybrid evolutionary algorithms based on crossing over the FFA, PSO, BAT, ACO and GA algorithms. The main idea of the proposed method is to integrate the aforementioned algorithms by following best solutions of other algorithm using roulette wheel approach. The aim of the proposed hybrid algorithm was to enable problem solving using two or more Evolutionary Algorithms as is, without modification, besides effectively exploring and exploiting of the problem search space. Simulations for a series of benchmark test functions justify that an adroit hybridization of various evolutionary algorithms could yield a robust and efficient means of solving wide range of global optimization problems than the standalone evolutionary algorithms."

                "text": "Evolutionary programming (EP) has been applied with success to many numerical and combinatorial optimization problems in recent years. EP has rather slow convergence rates, however, on some function optimization problems. In the paper, a \"fast EP\" (FEP) is proposed which uses a Cauchy instead of Gaussian mutation as the primary search operator. The relationship between FEP and classical EP (CEP) is similar to that between fast simulated annealing and the classical version. Both analytical and empirical studies have been carried out to evaluate the performance of FEP and CEP for different function optimization problems. The paper shows that FEP is very good at search in a large neighborhood while CEP is better at search in a small local neighborhood. For a suite of 23 benchmark problems, FEP performs much better than CEP for multimodal functions with many local minima while being comparable to CEP in performance for unimodal and multimodal functions with only a few local minima. The paper also shows the relationship between the search step size and the probability of finding a global optimum and thus explains why FEP performs better than CEP on some functions but not on others. In addition, the importance of the neighborhood size and its relationship to the probability of finding a near-optimum is investigated. Based on these analyses, an improved FEP (IFEP) is proposed and tested empirically. This technique mixes different search operators (mutations). The experimental results show that IFEP performs better than or as well as the better of FEP and CEP for most benchmark problems tested."

Statistical design of experiments (DoE) methods from the late 50s are also reviewed, and it is shown how relatives of these approaches are converging in modern sequential DoE/EA hybrid methods.The main characteristics of experimental optimization work, in comparison to optimization of simulated systems, are discussed, and practical guidelines for real-world experiments with EAs are given. For example, experimental problems can constrain the evolution due to overhead considerations, interruptions, changes of variables, and population sizes that are determined by the experimental platform.A series of modern-day case studies shows the persistence of experimental optimization problems today. These cover experimental quantum control, real DNA and RNA evolution, combinatorial drug discovery, coffee and chocolate processing, and others. These applications can push EA methods outside of their normal operating envelope, and raise research questions in a number of different areas ranging across constrained EAs, multiobjective EAs, robust and reliable methods for noisy problems, and metamodeling methods for expensive cost functions."

Recently, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) have received a growing interest in solving the multiobjective optimization problems. In this paper, MOPSO, and two highly competitive algorithms of MOEAs, that is, nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) are presented for solving the ORPD problem. Moreover, a mixed-variable handling method and an effective constraint handling approach are employed to deal with various types of variables and constraints. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on the standard IEEE 30-bus and 118-bus test systems. In addition, several multiobjective performance metrics are employed to compare these algorithms with respect to convergence, diversity, and computational efficiency. The results show the effectiveness of MOEAs and MOPSO for solving the ORPD problem. Furthermore, the comparison results indicate that MOPSO generally outperforms other algorithms for ORPD and has a great potential in dealing with large-scale optimal power flow problems."

Some empirical studies claim that evolutionary algorithms can produce good solutions to the 0-1 knapsack problem. Nonetheless, few rigorous investigations address the quality of solutions that evolutionary algorithms may produce for the knapsack problem. This paper focuses on a theoretical investigation of three types of (N+1) evolutionary algorithms that exploit bitwise mutation, truncation selection, plus different repair methods for the 0-1 knapsack problem. It assesses the solution quality in terms of the approximation ratio. Our work indicates that the solution produced by both pure strategy and mixed strategy evolutionary algorithms is arbitrarily bad. Nevertheless, an evolutionary algorithm using helper objectives may produce 1/2-approximation solutions to the 0-1 knapsack problem."

However, there are no related theoretical studies on this kind of MOEAs. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the MOEAs based on decomposition. First, we analyze the runtime complexity with two basic simple instances. In both cases the Pareto front have oneto-one map to the decomposed subproblems or not. Second, we analyze the runtime complexity on two difficult instances with bad neighborhood relations in fitness space or decision space. Our studies show that: 1) in certain cases, polynomialsized evenly distributed weight parameters-based decomposition cannot map each point in a polynomial sized Pareto front to a subproblem; 2) an ideal serialized algorithm can be very efficient on some simple instances; 3) the standard MOEA based on decomposition can benefit a runtime cut of a constant fraction from its neighborhood coevolution scheme; and 4) the standard MOEA based on decomposition performs well on difficult instances because both the Pareto domination-based and the scalar subproblem-based search schemes are combined in a proper way."

In order to improve the searching ability of differential evolution, two modified differential evolution are introduced by merging the mechanisms of quadratic approximation, Gaussian disturbing, immune theory and differential evolution. First, the simplified quadratic approximation is employed to improve the performance of the Immune Self-adaptive Differential Evolution and the novel algorithm is named Quadratic Approximation based Immune Self-adaptive Differential Evolution. Besides, the Gaussian disturbing is introduced into the framework of ISDE to improve the variety of the individual and the proposed algorithm is called Gaussian Disturbing based Immune Self-adaptive Differential Evolution. The performance of the proposed algorithms is tested by the benchmark problems and compared with original DE and ISDE. Both of the proposed algorithms outperform the compared algorithms.

A very popular approach is to parallelize evolution in island models, or coarse-grained EA s, by evolving different populations on different processors. These populations run independently most of the time, but they periodically communicate genetic information to coordinate search. Many applications have shown that island models can speed up computation significantly, and that parallel populations can further increase solution diversity."

They also added a chapter on problems, reflecting the overall book focus on problem-solvers, a chapter on parameter tuning, which they combined with the parameter control and \"how-to\" chapters into a methodological part, and finally a chapter on evolutionary robotics with an outlook on possible exciting developments in this field. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in artificial intelligence and computational intelligence, and for self-study by practitioners and researchers engaged with all aspects of bioinspired design and optimization."

The algorithm is labeled as dMAGAFCM-GRN. In dMAGAFCM-GRN, agents and their behaviors are designed with the intrinsic properties of GRN reconstruction problems in mind. All agents live in a lattice-like environment, and the neighbors of each agent are changed dynamically according to their energy in each generation. dMAGAFCM-GRN can learn continuous states directly for FCMs from data. In the experiments, the performance of dMAGAFCM-GRN is validated on both large-scale synthetic data and the benchmark DREAM3 and DREAM4. The experimental results show that dMAGAFCM-GRN is able to effectively learn FCMs with 200 nodes; that is, 40 000 weights need to be optimized. The systematic comparison with five existing algorithms shows that dMAGAFCM-GRN outperforms all other algorithms and can approximate the time series with high accuracy."
