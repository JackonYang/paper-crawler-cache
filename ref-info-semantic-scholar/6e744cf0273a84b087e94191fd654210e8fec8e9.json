We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is signicantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution."

Such a simplification is necessary since the interactions between network structure and function are not well understood. Evolutionary computations, which include genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming, are population-based search methods that have shown promise in many similarly complex tasks. This paper argues that genetic algorithms are inappropriate for network acquisition and describes an evolutionary program, called GNARL, that simultaneously acquires both the structure and weights for recurrent networks. GNARL's empirical acquisition method allows for the emergence of complex behaviors and topologies that are potentially excluded by the artificial architectural constraints imposed in standard network induction methods."

In this paper, we argue that complexification, i.e. the incremental elaboration of solutions through adding new structure, achieves both these goals. We demonstrate the power of complexification through the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method, which evolves increasingly complex neural network architectures. NEAT is applied to an open-ended coevolutionary robot duel domain where robot controllers compete head to head. Because the robot duel domain supports a wide range of strategies, and because coevolution benefits from an escalating arms race, it serves as a suitable testbed for studying complexification. When compared to the evolution of networks with fixed structure, complexifying evolution discovers significantly more sophisticated strategies. The results suggest that in order to discover and improve complex solutions, evolution, and search in general, should be allowed to complexify as well as optimize."

Direct Encoding encodes the weights for an a priori fixed neural network architecture. Cellular Encoding encodes both weights and the architecture of the neural network. In previous studies, Direct Encoding and Cellular Encoding have been used to create neural networks for balancing 1 and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed track. The poles are balanced by a controller that pushes the cart to the left or the right. In some cases velocity information about the pole and cart is provided as an input; in other cases the network must learn to balance a single pole without velocity information. A careful study of the behavior of these systems suggests that it is possible to balance a single pole with velocity information as an input and without learning to compute the velocity. A new fitness function is introduced that forces the neural network to compute the velocity. By using this new fitness function and tuning the syntactic constraints used with cellular encoding, we achieve a tenfold speedup over our previous study and solve a more difficult problem: balancing two poles when no information about the velocity is provided as input."

The classic pole balancing problem is no longer difficult enough to serve as a viable yardstick for measuring the learning efficiency of these systems. The double pole case, where two poles connected to the cart must be balanced simultaneously is much more difficult, especially when velocity information is not available. In this article, we demonstrate a neuroevolution system, Enforced Sub-populations (ESP), that is used to evolve a controller for the standard double pole task and a much harder, non-Markovian version. In both cases, our results show that ESP is faster than other neuroevolution methods. In addition, we introduce an incremental method that evolves on a sequence of tasks, and utilizes a local search technique (Delta-Coding) to sustain diversity. This method enables the system to solve even more difficult versions of the task where direct evolution cannot."

Researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing developmental encodings, i.e. encodings that map the genotype to the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a mature form. A major challenge in in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies. In this paper, a novel abstraction of natural development, called Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs), is proposed. Unlike currently accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations, CPPNs map to the phenotype without local interaction, that is, each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component. Results produced with CPPNs through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions, suggesting that local interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding in the way that is usually assumed."

In order to meet this challenge, many researchers are proposing indirect encodings, that is, evolutionary mechanisms where the same genes are used multiple times in the process of building a phenotype. Such gene reuse allows compact representations of very complex phenotypes. Development is a natural choice for implementing indirect encodings, if only because nature itself uses this very process. Motivated by the development of embryos in nature, we define artificial embryogeny (AE) as the subdiscipline of evolutionary computation (EC) in which phenotypes undergo a developmental phase. An increasing number of AE systems are currently being developed, and a need has arisen for a principled approach to comparing and contrasting, and ultimately building, such systems. Thus, in this paper, we develop a principled taxonomy for AE. This taxonomy provides a unified context for long-term research in AE, so that implementation decisions can be compared and contrasted along known dimensions in the design space of embryogenic systems. It also allows predicting how the settings of various AE parameters affect the capacity to efficiently evolve complex phenotypes."

Representations are usually engineered by hand and fixed for the duration of the GA run. Here a new method is described in which the degrees of freedom of the representation-i.e. the genes-are increased incrementally. The phenotypic effects of the new genes are randomly drawn from a space of different functional effects. Only those genes that initially increase fitness are kept. The genotype-phenotype map that results from this selection during the construction of the genome allows better adaptation. This effect is illustrated with the NK landscape model. The resulting genotype-phenotype maps are much less epistatic than unselected maps would be, having extremely low values of \"K\"-the number of fitness components affected by each gene. Moreover, these maps are exquisitely tuned to the specifics of the epistatic fitness function, creating adaptive landscapes that are much smoother than generic NK landscapes with the same genotype-phenotype maps, with fitness peaks many standard deviations higher. Thus a caveat should be made when making arguments about the applicability of generic properties of complex systems to evolved systems. This method may help to solve the problem of choice of representations in genetic algorithms.<<ETX>>"

At the bottom, slow changes to the genotype structure are mediated by natural selection. At the top, to cope with more transient factors, faster lifetime transformations are found.Lifetime adaptation also takes place at various levels, from the processes that are responsible for the organism construction and maintenance, to the regulation of behaviour based on instinctive responses, cognitive abilities and social interactions.The traditional GOFAI (Good Old Fashion Artificial Intelligence) stand is based on the view of intelligence as computation taking place on a internal symbolic representations of the outside world. Powered by deductive logic, the classical artificial reasoner is centered on the possibility to describe reality within a symbolic framework. Unfortunately, this approach fails to cope with the ambiguous nature of reality, where good decisions are often based on partial and inconsistent knowledge. In these cases, reasoning could appear irrational, while its rationale is actually found in the necessity to take action.To solve this problem, New AI hypothesizes that intelligent behaviour must be understood within the framework provided by the agent\u2019s physical interactions with the environment: subjective sensations and bodily interactions.The result is a bottom-up exploration, which starts from the lowest adaptive mechanisms to reach the topmost cognitive abilities. The work presented in this thesis follows this hypothesis, analyzing multiple levels of adaptive mechanisms: evolution, development, learning and culture."

This paper defines a class of representations called generative representations, which are identified by their ability to reuse elements of the genotype in the translation to the phenotype. This paper presents an example of a generative representation for the concurrent evolution of the morphology and neural controller of simulated robots, and also introduces GENRE, an evolutionary system for evolving designs using this representation. Applying GENRE to the task of evolving robots for locomotion and comparing it against a non-generative (direct) representation shows that the generative representation system rapidly produces robots with significantly greater fitness. Analyzing these results shows that the generative representation system achieves better performance by capturing useful bias from the design space and by allowing viable large scale mutations in the phenotype. Generative representations thereby enable the encapsulation, coordination, and reuse of assemblies of parts."

Instead of development, CPPNs employ compositions of functions derived from gradient patterns present in developing natural organisms.

Increasing a representation's capacity to facilitate effective search, i.e. its evolvability, has long been a goal of Evolutionary Computation. However, currently no benchmarks exist to measure evolvability. One reason is that it is difficult to decouple a representation's capacity to evolve under any fitness function, i.e. the latent evolvability, and its performance on a specific benchmark. Towards this goal, a method is proposed in this paper that measures the representation's ability to extract invariant properties from a changing fitness function. The test is applied to three distinct representations and it is able to distinguish all three. Ultimately, this test can serve as the foundation for performing controlled experiments determining what factors contribute to evolvability."

This essay highlights several unique characteristics of brain networks and explores how a computational analysis of these networks (see also [4]) may impact on our understanding of human brain function.

Neurons in the cerebral cortex maintain thousands of input and output connections with other neurons, forming a dense network of connectivity spanning the entire thalamocortical system. According to a detailed quantitative study [5], the human cerebral cortex contains approximately 8.3 10 neurons and 6.7 10 connections. The length of all connections within a single human brain is estimated between 100,000 and 10,000,000 km [5].

Brain networks are not random, but form highly specific patterns. A predominant feature of brain networks is that neurons tend to connect predominantly with other neurons in local groups. Thus, local connectivity ratios can be significantly higher than those suggested by random topology. Networks in the brain can be analyzed at multiple levels of scale. Within small and localized region of the brain, neurons form characteristic sets of connections, socalled local circuits [6]. For example, neurons forming cortical columns show specific patterns of connectivity between morphologically and pharmacologically distinct classes of cells in different layers. At a higher level of scale, such columns communicate through \u201ctangential\u201d or \u201chorizontal\u201d connections, forming networks of columns within single cortical areas.

The system uses marker-based genes to encode nodes in a neural network. The game-playing networks were forced to evolve sophisticated strategies in Othello to compete first with a random mover and then with an alpha-beta search program. Without any direction, the networks discovered first the standard positional strategy, and subsequently the mobility strategy, an advanced strategy rarely seen outside of tournaments. The latter discovery demonstrates how evolution can develop novel solutions by turning an initial disadvantage into an advantage in a changed environment."

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning."

Pairs of individuals enter one-on-one contests in which they contend to gain control of a common resource. The winners receive higher relative fitness scores allowing them to survive and reproduce. Realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. The morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. The genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components. When simulated evolutions are performed with populations of competing creatures, interesting and diverse strategies and counterstrategies emerge."

Yet, if game characters could learn through interacting with the player, behavior could improve as the game is played, keeping it interesting. This paper introduces the real-time Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (rtNEAT) method for evolving increasingly complex artificial neural networks in real time, as a game is being played. The rtNEAT method allows agents to change and improve during the game. In fact, rtNEAT makes possible an entirely new genre of video games in which the player trains a team of agents through a series of customized exercises. To demonstrate this concept, the Neuroevolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game was built based on rtNEAT. In NERO, the player trains a team of virtual robots for combat against other players' teams. This paper describes results from this novel application of machine learning, and demonstrates that rtNEAT makes possible video games like NERO where agents evolve and adapt in real time. In the future, rtNEAT may allow new kinds of educational and training applications through interactive and adapting games."

The complex phenotypes used in such systems often require nontrivial encodings. Different encodings used in Framsticksa system for evolving three-dimensional agentsare presented. These include a low-level direct mapping and two higher-level encodings: one recurrent and one developmental. Quantitative results are presented from three simple optimization tasks (passive height, active height, and locomotion speed). The low-level encoding produced solutions of lower fitness than the two higher-level encodings under similar conditions. Results from recurrent and developmental encodings had similar fitness values but displayed qualitative differences.

Currently, most machine learning methods tackle Go by playing on a speciflc flxed board size, usually smaller than the standard 19\u00a319 board of the com- plete game. Because such techniques are designed to process only one board size, the knowledge gained through experience cannot be applied on larger boards. In this paper, a roving eye neural network is evolved to solve this problem. The network has a small input fleld that can scan boards of any size. Experiments demonstrate that (1) The same roving eye architecture can play on difierent board sizes, and (2) experience gained by playing on a small board provides an advantage for further learning on a larger board. These results suggest a potentially power- ful new methodology for computer Go: It may be possible to scale up by learning on incrementally larger boards, each time building on knowledge acquired on the prior board."

It demonstrates a virtual marine world inhabited by realistic artificial fishes. Our algorithms emulate not only the appearance, movement, and behavior of individual animals, but also the complex group behaviors evident in many aquatic ecosystems. We model each animal holistically. An artificial fish is an autonomous agent situated in a simulated physical world. The agent has (a) a three-dimensional body with internal muscle actuators and functional fins that deforms and locomotes in accordance with biomechanic and hydrodynamic principles; (b) sensors, including eyes that can image the environment; and (c) a brain with motor, perception, behavior, and learning centers. Artificial fishes exhibit a repertoire of piscatorial behaviors that rely on their perceptual awareness of their dynamic habitat. Individual and emergent collective behaviors include caudal and pectoral locomotion, collision avoidance, foraging, preying, schooling, and mating. Furthermore, artificial fishes can learn how to locomote through practice and sensory reinforcement. Their motor learning algorithms discover muscle controllers that produce efficient hydrodynamic locomotion. The learning algorithms also enable artificial fishes to train themselves to accomplish higher level, perceptually guided motor tasks, such as maneuvering to reach a visible target."

Following a summary of the significant features of embryogenies, the three main types of embryogenies in Evolutionary Computation are then identified and explained: external, explicit and implicit. An experimental comparison between these three different embryogenies and an evolutionary algorithm with no embryogeny is performed. The problem set to the four evolutionary systems is to evolve tessellating tiles. In order to assess the scalability of the embryogenies, the problem is increased in difficulty by enlarging the size of tiles to be evolved. The results are surprising, with the implicit embryogeny outperforming all other techniques by showing no significant increase in the size of the genotypes or decrease in accuracy of evolution as the scale of the problem is increased."

For evolutionary techniques to scale to the complexities necessary for actual engineering problems, it has been argued that generative systems, where the genotype is an algorithm for constructing the final design, should be used as the encoding. We describe a system for creating generative specifications by combining Lindenmayer systems with evolutionary algorithms, and we apply it to the problem of generating table designs. Designs evolved by our system reach an order of magnitude more parts than previous generative systems. Comparing it against a non-generative encoding, we find that the generative system produces designs with higher fitness and is faster than the non-generative system. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our system to go from design to manufacture by constructing evolved table designs using rapid prototyping equipment."

What determines the organization of cortical maps? We argue that cortical maps reflect neuronal connectivity in intracortical circuits. Because connecting distant neurons requires costly wiring (i.e., axons and dendrites), there is an evolutionary pressure to place connected neurons as close to each other as possible. Then, cortical maps may be viewed as solutions that minimize wiring cost for given intracortical connectivity. These solutions can help us in inferring intracortical connectivity and, ultimately, in understanding the function of the visual system."

These so called Artificial Embryogeny systems have so far shown increased scalability for problems involving solutions of low complexity. This leaves open the more general question about the evolvability of complex phenotypes. In this paper, we introduce a novel method of cellular growth regulated by a developmental program. Genotypes are selected for their ability to develop organisms of specific shape and cell types. Results show that the use of Embryonic Stages, which involves the incremental addition of growth programs, displays positive effects on the evolvability of development."

Creating such warning systems by hand, however, is a difficult and time-consuming task. This paper describes three advances toward evolving neural networks with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to warn about such crashes in real-world environments. First, NEAT was evaluated in a complex, dynamic simulation with other cars, where it outperformed three hand-coded strawman warning policies and generated warning levels comparable with those of an open-road warning system. Second, warning networks were trained using raw pixel data from a simulated camera. Surprisingly, NEAT was able to generate warning networks that performed similarly to those trained with higher-level input and still outperformed the baseline hand-coded warning policies. Third, the NEAT approach was evaluated in the real world using a robotic vehicle testbed. Despite noisy and ambiguous sensor data, NEAT successfully evolved warning networks using both laser rangefinders and visual sensors. The results in this paper set the stage for developing warning networks for real-world traffic, which may someday save lives in real vehicles."

Removal of afferent input to the somatosensory, auditory, motor or visual cortex results in a marked change of cortical topography1\u201310. Changes in sensory activity can, over a period of months, alter receptive field size and cortical topography11. Here we remove visual input by focal binocular retinal lesions and record from the same cortical sites before and within minutes after making the lesion and find immediate striking increases in receptive field size for cortical cells with receptive fields near the edge of the retinal scotoma. After a few months even the cortical areas that were initially silenced by the lesion recover visual activity, representing retinotopic loci surrounding the lesion. At the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus, which provides the visual input to the striate cortex, a large silent region remains. Furthermore, anatomical studies show that the spread of geniculocortical afferents is insufficient to account for the cortical recovery. The results indicate that the topographic reorganization within the cortex was largely due to synaptic changes intrinsic to the cortex, perhaps through the plexus of long-range horizontal connections."

A number of \"no free lunch\" (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori \"head-to-head\" minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms."

                "text": "It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns onHydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis.The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading."

In \"The Shape of Life\", Raff analyzes the rise of this experimental discipline and lays out research questions, hypotheses and approaches to guide its development. Raff uses the evolution of animal body plans to exemplify the interplay between developmental mechanisms and evolutionary patterns. Animal body plans emerged half a billion years ago. Evolution within these body plans during this span of time has resulted in the tremendous diversity of living animal forms. Raff argues for an integrated approach to the study of the intertwined roles of development and evolution involving phylogenetic, comparative and functional biology. This synthesis should interest not only scientists working in these areas, but also paleontologists, zoologists, morphologists, molecular biologists and geneticists."

These hypotheses predict episodic expansion of gene families early in vertebrate evolution (mostly before the origin of fishes), tetralogous relationships between gene copies samples from invertebrates and vertebrates, and gene family trees with symmetrical shapes. None of these predictions were evident from a phylogenetic analysis of 35 gene families. Overall, the results do not refute the hypothesis that gene family evolution is governed by independent gene duplications occurring with identical probability across gene lineages. These results suggest that the genome complexity of contemporary vertebrates mostly reflect small\u2010scale (regional) DNA duplications instead of large\u2010scale (genomic) duplications."

In this paper, an example of the predator-prey problem is studied in which four predator agents, using the reinforcement learning method, in an attempt to collectively achieve the task of surrounding one prey agent. First, we describe the structure of the predator agents and the prey agent with their state sensing capability, the action learning method and the action choosing mechanism. Next we study two cooperative behavior mechanisms between agents of multi-agent systems in predator-prey problem. Finally, we demonstrate that cooperative agents outperform agents without cooperative behavior according to simulations of the predator-prey problem and display the corresponding experimental results."

Each layer contains different cell types, and forms different types of connections with other neurons. However, a strong vertical organization is often also apparent: neurons stacked on top of each other through the depth of the cortex tend to be connected and have similar response properties despite residing in different layers. This type of vertical structure is called a cortical column, and has been hypothesized to represent a basic functional unit for sensory processing or motor output. Columnar organization has been most extensively studied in the somatosensory and visual systems."
