We present a selection of case studies and topics drawn from recent experiments in the setting of a deployed CTR prediction system. These include improvements in the context of traditional supervised learning based on an FTRL-Proximal online learning algorithm (which has excellent sparsity and convergence properties) and the use of per-coordinate learning rates. We also explore some of the challenges that arise in a real-world system that may appear at first to be outside the domain of traditional machine learning research. These include useful tricks for memory savings, methods for assessing and visualizing performance, practical methods for providing confidence estimates for predicted probabilities, calibration methods, and methods for automated management of features. Finally, we also detail several directions that did not turn out to be beneficial for us, despite promising results elsewhere in the literature. The goal of this paper is to highlight the close relationship between theoretical advances and practical engineering in this industrial setting, and to show the depth of challenges that appear when applying traditional machine learning methods in a complex dynamic system."

In this paper, we show how response prediction can be viewed as a problem of matrix completion, and propose to solve it using matrix factorization techniques from collaborative filtering (CF). We point out the two crucial differences between standard CF problems and response prediction, namely the requirement of predicting probabilities rather than scores, and the issue of confidence in matrix entries. We address these issues using a matrix factorization analogue of logistic regression, and by applying a principled confidence-weighting scheme to its objective. We show how this factorization can be seamlessly combined with explicit features or side-information for pages and ads, which let us combine the benefits of both approaches. Finally, we combat the extreme sparsity of response prediction data by incorporating hierarchical information about the pages and ads into our factorization model. Experiments on three very large real-world datasets show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for response prediction."

Choosing the right ads for the query and the order in which they are displayed greatly affects the probability that a user will see and click on each ad. This ranking has a strong impact on the revenue the search engine receives from the ads. Further, showing the user an ad that they prefer to click on improves user satisfaction. For these reasons, it is important to be able to accurately estimate the click-through rate of ads in the system. For ads that have been displayed repeatedly, this is empirically measurable, but for new ads, other means must be used. We show that we can use features of ads, terms, and advertisers to learn a model that accurately predicts the click-though rate for new ads. We also show that using our model improves the convergence and performance of an advertising system. As a result, our model increases both revenue and user satisfaction."

The Matchbox system makes use of content information in the form of user and item meta data in combination with collaborative filtering information from previous user behavior in order to predict the value of an item for a user. Users and items are represented by feature vectors which are mapped into a low-dimensional `trait space' in which similarity is measured in terms of inner products. The model can be trained from different types of feedback in order to learn user-item preferences. Here we present three alternatives: direct observation of an absolute rating each user gives to some items, observation of a binary preference (like/ don't like) and observation of a set of ordinal ratings on a user-specific scale. Efficient inference is achieved by approximate message passing involving a combination of Expectation Propagation (EP) and Variational Message Passing. We also include a dynamics model which allows an item's popularity, a user's taste or a user's personal rating scale to drift over time. By using Assumed-Density Filtering (ADF) for training, the model requires only a single pass through the training data. This is an on-line learning algorithm capable of incrementally taking account of new data so the system can immediately reflect the latest user preferences. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on the MovieLens and Netflix data sets consisting of approximately 1,000,000 and 100,000,000 ratings respectively. This demonstrates that training the model using the on-line ADF approach yields state-of-the-art performance with the option of improving performance further if computational resources are available by performing multiple EP passes over the training data."

The algorithm is based on a probit regression model that maps discrete or real-valued input features to probabilities. It maintains Gaussian beliefs over weights of the model and performs Gaussian online updates derived from approximate message passing. Scalability of the algorithm is ensured through a principled weight pruning procedure and an approximate parallel implementation. We discuss the challenges arising from evaluating and tuning the predictor as part of the complex system of sponsored search where the predictions made by the algorithm decide about future training sample composition. Finally, we show experimental results from the production system and compare to a calibrated Naive Bayes algorithm."

Such problems are routine in several data mining applications including computational advertising, our main focus in this paper. We propose LMMH, a novel log-linear modeling method that scales to massive data applications with billions of training records and several million potential predictors in a map-reduce framework. Our method exploits correlations in aggregates observed at multiple resolutions when working with multiple hierarchies; stable estimates at coarser resolution provide informative prior information to improve estimates at finer resolutions. Other than prediction accuracy and scalability, our method has an inbuilt variable screening procedure based on a \"spike and slab prior\" that provides parsimony by removing non-informative predictors without hurting predictive accuracy. We perform large scale experiments on data from real computational advertising applications and illustrate our approach on datasets with several billion records and hundreds of millions of predictors. Extensive comparisons with other benchmark methods show significant improvements in prediction accuracy."

Efficient algorithms have been proposed for this task, but they are impractical when the number of parameters is very large. We present an algorithm Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton (OWL-QN), based on L-BFGS, that can efficiently optimize the L1-regularized log-likelihood of log-linear models with millions of parameters. In our experiments on a parse reranking task, our algorithm was several orders of magnitude faster than an alternative algorithm, and substantially faster than L-BFGS on the analogous L2-regularized problem. We also present a proof that OWL-QN is guaranteed to converge to a globally optimal parameter vector."

The 'lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described."

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis\u2010of\u2010variance problem as the most important and well\u2010known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non\u2010negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non\u2010negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods."

However, the flexibility of ME models is not without cost. While parameter estimation for ME models is conceptually straightforward, in practice ME models for typical natural language tasks are very large, and may well contain many thousands of free parameters. In this paper, we consider a number of algorithms for estimating the parameters of ME models, including iterative scaling, gradient ascent, conjugate gradient, and variable metric methods. Sur-prisingly, the standardly used iterative scaling algorithms perform quite poorly in comparison to the others, and for all of the test problems, a limited-memory variable metric algorithm outperformed the other choices."

We give an update formula which generates matrices using information from the last m iterations, where m is any number supplied by the user. The quasi-Newton matrix is updated at every iteration by dropping the oldest information and replacing it by the newest informa- tion. It is shown that the matrices generated have some desirable properties. The resulting algorithms are tested numerically and compared with several well- known methods. 1. Introduction. For the problem of minimizing an unconstrained function / of n variables, quasi-Newton methods are widely employed (4). They construct a se- quence of matrices which in some way approximate the hessian of /(or its inverse). These matrices are symmetric; therefore, it is necessary to have n(n + l)/2 storage locations for each one. For large dimensional problems it will not be possible to re- tain the matrices in the high speed storage of a computer, and one has to resort to other kinds of algorithms. For example, one could use the methods (Toint (15), Shanno (12)) which preserve the sparsity structure of the hessian, or conjugate gradient methods (CG) which only have to store 3 or 4 vectors. Recently, some CG algorithms have been developed which use a variable amount of storage and which do not require knowledge about the sparsity structure of the problem (2), (7), (8). A disadvantage of these methods is that after a certain number of iterations the quasi-Newton matrix is discarded, and the algorithm is restarted using an initial matrix (usually a diagonal matrix). We describe an algorithm which uses a limited amount of storage and where the quasi-Newton matrix is updated continuously. At every step the oldest information contained in the matrix is discarded and replaced by new one. In this way we hope to have a more up to date model of our function. We will concentrate on the BFGS method since it is considered to be the most efficient. We believe that similar algo- rithms cannot be developed for the other members of the Broyden 0-class (1). Let / be the function to be nnnimized, g its gradient and h its hessian. We define"

Only quadratic functions are considered but particular attention is paid to the magnitude of successive errors and their dependence upon the initial matrix. On the basis of this a possible explanation of some of the observed characteristics of the class is tentatively suggested. PROBABLY the best-known algorithm for determining the unconstrained minimum of a function of many variables, where explicit expressions are available for the first partial derivatives, is that of Davidon (1959) as modified by Fletcher & Powell (1963). This algorithm has many virtues. It is simple and does not require at any stage the solution of linear equations. It minimizes a quadratic function exactly in a finite number of steps and this property makes convergence of this algorithm rapid, when applied to more general functions, in the neighbourhood of the solution. It is, at least in theory, stable since the iteration matrix H,, which transforms the jth gradient into the /th step direction, may be shown to be positive definite. In practice the algorithm has been generally successful, but it has exhibited some puzzling behaviour. Broyden (1967) noted that H, does not always remain positive definite, and attributed this to rounding errors. Pearson (1968) found that for some problems the solution was obtained more efficiently if H, was reset to a positive definite matrix, often the unit matrix, at intervals during the computation. Bard (1968) noted that H, could become singular, attributed this to rounding error and suggested the use of suitably chosen scaling factors as a remedy. In this paper we analyse the more general algorithm given by Broyden (1967), of which the DFP algorithm is a special case, and determine how for quadratic functions the choice of an arbitrary parameter affects convergence. We investigate how the successive errors depend, again for quadratic functions, upon the initial choice of iteration matrix paying particular attention to the cases where this is either the unit matrix or a good approximation to the inverse Hessian. We finally give a tentative explanation of some of the observed experimental behaviour in the case where the function to be minimized is not quadratic."

We show how Tikhonov's regularization method, which in its original formulation involves a least squares problem, can be recast in a total least squares formulation suited for problems in which both the coefficient matrix and the right-hand side are known only approximately. We analyze the regularizing properties of this method and demonstrate by a numerical example that, in certain cases with large perturbations, the new method is superior to standard regularization methods."

The estimates have the attractive property of being invariant under groupwise orthogonal reparameterizations. We extend the group lasso to logistic regression models and present an efficient algorithm, that is especially suitable for high dimensional problems, which can also be applied to generalized linear models to solve the corresponding convex optimization problem. The group lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sample size but with sparse true underlying structure. We further use a two\u2010stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the group lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, owing to the two\u2010stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical. The methods are used on simulated and real data sets about splice site detection in DNA sequences."

Finding the best ad impression, i.e., the opportunity to show an ad to a user, requires the ability to estimate the probability that the user who sees the ad on his or her browser will take an action, i.e., the user will convert. However, conversion probability estimation is a challenging task since there is extreme data sparsity across different data dimensions and the conversion event occurs rarely. In this paper, we present our approach to conversion rate estimation which relies on utilizing past performance observations along user, publisher and advertiser data hierarchies. More specifically, we model the conversion event at different select hierarchical levels with separate binomial distributions and estimate the distribution parameters individually. Then we demonstrate how we can combine these individual estimators using logistic regression to accurately identify conversion events. In our presentation, we also discuss main practical considerations such as data imbalance, missing data, and output probability calibration, which render this estimation problem more difficult but yet need solving for a real-world implementation of the approach. We provide results from real advertising campaigns to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."
