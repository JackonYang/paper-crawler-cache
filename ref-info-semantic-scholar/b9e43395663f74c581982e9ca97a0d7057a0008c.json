On the basis of Property P, Frieze defined sets OP1 and OP2 and proved Theorem 3 which may be effective in the search for optimal solutions. Reading Frieze's note [1] provoked the question: Is there any connection between the results of [1] and \"the method of successive calculations\" 1 [2] ? In [21, V.P.

Thus, to maximize its available funds, a company that pays bills to numerous clients in various locations may find it advantageous to maintain accounts in several strategically located banks. We will discuss the problem of optimally locating bank accounts to maximize clearing times. The importance of this problem depends in part on its mathematical equivalence to the well-known uncapacitated plant location problem. We present a Lagrangian dual for obtaining an upper bound and heuristics for obtaining a lower bound on the value of an optimal solution. Our main results are analytical worst-case analyses of these bounds. In particular we show that the relative error of the dual bound and a \"greedy\" heuristic never exceeds [(K - 1)/K] k"

It is further shown that certain other cooperative solution concepts are related in a simple way to the core: The value of a convex game is the center of gravity of the extreme points of the core, and the von Neumann-Morgenstern stable set solution of a convex game is unique and coincides with the core."
