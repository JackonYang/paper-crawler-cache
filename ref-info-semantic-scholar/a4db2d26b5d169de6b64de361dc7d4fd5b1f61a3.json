However, efficient implementation of deep neural networks is difficult because the network size needs to be very large when high recognition accuracy is demanded. In this work, we develop a digital VLSI for phoneme recognition using deep neural networks and assess the design in terms of throughput, chip size, and power consumption. The developed VLSI employs a fixed-point optimization method that only uses +\u0394, 0, and -\u0394 for representing each of the weight. The design employs 1,024 simple processing units in each layer, which however can be scaled easily according to the needed throughput, and the throughput of the architecture varies from 62.5 to 1,000 times of the real-time processing speed."

By applying this algorithm, the digital hardware implementation of such networks becomes easier as a result of the elimination of multipliers. This proposed algorithm consists of two stages. First, the network is trained by using the standard backpropagation algorithm. Weights are then quantized to single powers-of-two values, and weights and slopes of activation functions are adjusted adaptively to reduce the sum of squared output errors to a specified level. Simulation results indicate that the multilayer feedforward neural networks with single powers-of-two weights obtained using the proposed algorithm have generalization performance similar to that of the original networks with continuous weights. >"

The reduced silicon area required to implement a single processing unit is taken advantage of by implementing multiple processing units on a single piece of silicon and operating them in parallel. The important question which arises is how much precision is required to implement neural network algorithms on this low precision hardware. A theoretical analysis of error due to finite precision computation was undertaken to determine the necessary precision for successful forward retrieving and back-propagation learning in a multilayer perceptron. This analysis can easily be further extended to provide a general finite precision analysis technique by which most neural network algorithms under any set of hardware constraints may be evaluated. >"

While reducing errors by 33% compared to its discriminatively trained Gaussian-mixture counterpart on the switchboard benchmark task, DNN requires much more parameters. In this paper, we report our recent work on DNN for improved generalization, model size, and computation speed by exploiting parameter sparseness. We formulate the goal of enforcing sparseness as soft regularization and convex constraint optimization problems, and propose solutions under the stochastic gradient ascent setting. We also propose novel data structures to exploit the random sparseness patterns to reduce model size and computation time. The proposed solutions have been evaluated on the voice-search and switchboard datasets. They have decreased the number of nonzero connections to one third while reducing the error rate by 0.2-0.3% over the fully connected model on both datasets. The nonzero connections have been further reduced to only 12% and 19% on the two respective datasets without sacrificing speech recognition performance. Under these conditions we can reduce the model size to 18% and 29%, and computation to 14% and 23%, respectively, on these two datasets."

Deep neural nets have also achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random \u201cdropout\u201d procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU) non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that modified deep neural networks using ReLUs trained with dropout during frame level training provide an 4.2% relative improvement over a DNN trained with sigmoid units, and a 14.4% relative improvement over a strong GMM/HMM system. We were able to obtain our results with minimal human hyper-parameter tuning using publicly available Bayesian optimization code."

This \"overfitting\" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \"dropout\" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition."

One of the major problems in using neural networks for optical computers is that the information holders: the interconnection strengths (or weights) are normally real valued (continuous), whereas optics (light) is only capable of representing a few distinguishable intensity levels (discrete). In this paper a weight discretization paradigm is presented for back(ward error) propagation neural networks which can work with a very limited number of discretization levels. The number of interconnections in a (fully connected) neural network grows quadratically with the number of neurons of the network. Optics can handle a large number of interconnections because of the fact that light beams do not interfere with each other. A vast amount of light beams can therefore be used per unit of area. However the number of different values one can represent in a light beam is very limited. A flexible, portable (machine independent) neural network software package which is capable of weight discretization, is presented. The development of the software and some experiments have been done on personal computers. The major part of the testing, which requires a lot of computation, has been done using a CRAY X-MP/24 super computer."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters. These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models."

We show that our method, despite its simplicity, yields state-of-the-art classification results on a highly competitive digit-recognition benchmark. We first employ the unsupervised Sparsenet algorithm to learn a basis for representing patches of handwritten digit images. We then use this basis to extract local coefficients. In a second step, we apply a local maximum operation to implement local shift invariance. Finally, we train a support vector machine (SVM) on the resulting feature vectors and obtain state-of-the-art classification performance in the digit recognition task defined by the MNIST benchmark. We compare the different classification performances obtained with sparse coding, Gabor wavelets, and principal component analysis (PCA). We conclude that the learning of a sparse representation of local image patches combined with a local maximum operation for feature extraction can significantly improve recognition performance."

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."
