We describe the algorithm used to compute the gradients automatically for a given network. We also propose a low-cost automatic learning rate selection algorithm and demonstrate that it works well in practice. 1 Computational Network Toolkit A computational network (CN) is a directed graph in which each leaf represents an input value or a learnable parameter and each node represents an operator. Figure 1 illustrates an example CN of a log-linear model. Here, each node is identified by a {node name : operator type} pair and takes its ordered children as the operator\u2019s inputs. For example, in the figure, T = Times(W,X) which is different from T = Times(X,W). A CN can have many root nodes which are used under different conditions. For example, one root node may represent a cross-entropy training criterion and another may represent an evaluation criterion. The network in Figure 1 has only one root node {C: Cross Entropy}. Many machine learning models, such as neural networks, that can be described via a series of operations, can be converted into a CN. The computational network toolkit (CNTK) is a general purpose C++ based machine learning toolkit for models that can be described as CNs. Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of CNTK. The core of CNTK is an internal representation of a CN which provides two key methods: Evaluate, which computes the value of a node given its inputs and Compute Gradient, which computes the gradient of a node with respect to its inputs. These methods are executed using an IExecutionEngine such as a CPU, a GPU, or a data flow graph such as pTask [1]. ICNBuilder reads the network description (or language) and creates a CN. IDataReader reads in features and labels stored in different formats."

Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary speech tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is the optimal number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy, and the best input feature type for CNNs. We then explore the behavior of neural network features extracted from CNNs on a variety of LVCSR tasks, comparing CNNs to DNNs and GMMs. We find that CNNs offer between a 13-30% relative improvement over GMMs, and a 4-12% relative improvement over DNNs, on a 400-hr Broadcast News and 300-hr Switchboard task."

Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or \"gated\") connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling \u2013 a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date."

In this paper, we extend the earlier basic form of the CNN and explore it in multiple ways. We first investigate several CNN architectures, including full and limited weight sharing, convolution along frequency and time axes, and stacking of several convolution layers. We then develop a novel weighted softmax pooling layer so that the size in the pooling layer can be automatically learned. Further, we evaluate the effect of CNN pretraining, which is achieved by using a convolutional version of the RBM. We show that all CNN architectures we have investigated outperform the earlier basic form of the DNN on both the phone recognition and large vocabulary speech recognition tasks. The architecture with limited weight sharing provides additional gains over the full weight sharing architecture. The softmax pooling layer performs as well as the best CNN with the manually tuned fixed-pooling size, and has a potential for further improvement. Finally, we show that CNN pretraining produces significantly better results on a large vocabulary speech recognition task."

The key feature is a high flexibility regarding the network topology, choice of activation functions, training criteria, and optimization algorithm, as well as a built-in support for efficient GPU computing. The evaluation of run-time performance and recognition accuracy is performed exemplary with a deep neural network as acoustic model in a hybrid NN/HMM system.

This has also been confirmed experimentally, with CNNs showing improvements in word error rate (WER) between 4-12% relative compared to DNNs across a variety of LVCSR tasks. In this paper, we describe different methods to further improve CNN performance. First, we conduct a deep analysis comparing limited weight sharing and full weight sharing with state-of-the-art features. Second, we apply various pooling strategies that have shown improvements in computer vision to an LVCSR speech task. Third, we introduce a method to effectively incorporate speaker adaptation, namely fMLLR, into log-mel features. Fourth, we introduce an effective strategy to use dropout during Hessian-free sequence training. We find that with these improvements, particularly with fMLLR and dropout, we are able to achieve an additional 2-3% relative improvement in WER on a 50-hour Broadcast News task over our previous best CNN baseline. On a larger 400-hour BN task, we find an additional 4-5% relative improvement over our previous best CNN baseline."

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."

However, they can be difficult to implement and are usually slower than traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We present three novel approaches to speeding up CNNs: a) unrolling convolution, b) using BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines), and c) using GPUs (graphic processing units). Unrolled convolution converts the processing in each convolutional layer (both forward-propagation and back-propagation) into a matrix-matrix product. The matrix-matrix product representation of CNNs makes their implementation as easy as MLPs. BLAS is used to efficiently compute matrix products on the CPU. We also present a pixel shader based GPU implementation of CNNs. Results on character recognition problems indicate that unrolled convolution with BLAS produces a dramatic 2.4X\u22123.0X speedup. The GPU implementation is even faster and produces a 3.1X\u22124.1X speedup."

This method is inspired by the idea from variable-parameter HMM (VPHMM) in which the variation of model parameters are modeled as a set of polynomial functions of environmental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and during the testing, the model parameters are recomputed according to the estimated testing SNR. In VCDNN, we refine two types of DNN components: (1) weighting matrix and bias (2) the output of each layer. Experimental results on Aurora4 task show VCDNN achieved 6.53% and 5.92% relative word error rate reduction (WERR) over the standard DNN for the two methods, respectively. Under unseen SNR conditions, VCDNN gave even better result (8.46% relative WERR for the DNN varying matrix and bias, 7.08% relative WERR for the DNN varying layer output). Moreover, VCDNN with 1024 units per hidden layer beats the standard DNN with 2048 units per hidden layer with 3.22% WERR and a half computational/memory cost reduction, showing superior ability to produce sharper and more compact models."

In this work, we show approaches that lead to more than 15 times speedup for both training and testing phases. Next, we show importance of using a backpropagation through time algorithm. An empirical comparison with feedforward networks is also provided. In the end, we discuss possibilities how to reduce the amount of parameters in the model. The resulting RNN model can thus be smaller, faster both during training and testing, and more accurate than the basic one."

In this paper, we improve their performance by providing a contextual real-valued input vector in association with each word. This vector is used to convey contextual information about the sentence being modeled. By performing Latent Dirichlet Allocation using a block of preceding text, we achieve a topic-conditioned RNNLM. This approach has the key advantage of avoiding the data fragmentation associated with building multiple topic models on different data subsets. We report perplexity results on the Penn Treebank data, where we achieve a new state-of-the-art. We further apply the model to the Wall Street Journal speech recognition task, where we observe improvements in word-error-rate."

For traditional models it is known that the addition of for example part-of-speech information and topical information can improve performance. In this paper we investigate the usefulness of additional features for RNNLM. We look at four types of features: POS tags, lemmas, and the topics and the socio-situational setting of a conversation. In our experiments, almost all RNNLM models that make use of extra information outperform our baseline RNNLM model in terms of both perplexity and word prediction accuracy. Whereas the baseline model has a perplexity of 114.79, the model that uses a combination of POS tags, sociosituational settings and lemmas achieves the lowest perplexity result of 83.59, and the combination of all 4 types of features, using a network with 500 hidden neurons, achieves the highest word prediction accuracy of 23.11%."

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

Conventionally, bottleneck features are extracted from a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained to predict context-independent monophone states. The MLP typically has three hidden layers and is trained using the backpropagation algorithm. In this paper, we propose two improvements to the training of bottleneck features motivated by recent advances in the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for speech recognition. First, we show how the use of unsupervised pretraining of a DNN enhances the network\u2019s discriminative power and improves the bottleneck features it generates. Second, we show that a neural network trained to predict context-dependent senone targets produces better bottleneck features than one trained to predict monophone states. Bottleneck features trained using the proposed methods produced a 16% relative reduction in sentence error rate over conventional bottleneck features on a large vocabulary business search task."

The success is largely attributed to the use of local filtering and max-pooling in the CNN architecture. In this paper, we propose to apply CNN to speech recognition within the framework of hybrid NN-HMM model. We propose to use local filtering and max-pooling in frequency domain to normalize speaker variance to achieve higher multi-speaker speech recognition performance. In our method, a pair of local filtering layer and max-pooling layer is added at the lowest end of neural network (NN) to normalize spectral variations of speech signals. In our experiments, the proposed CNN architecture is evaluated in a speaker independent speech recognition task using the standard TIMIT data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed CNN method can achieve over 10% relative error reduction in the core TIMIT test sets when comparing with a regular NN using the same number of hidden layers and weights. Our results also show that the best result of the proposed CNN model is better than previously published results on the same TIMIT test sets that use a pre-trained deep NN model."

The design of the pooling layer is guided by domain knowledge about how speech classes would change when formant frequencies are modified. The convolution and heterogeneous-pooling layers are followed by a fully connected multi-layer neural network to form a deep architecture interfaced to an HMM for continuous speech recognition. During training, all layers of this entire deep net are regularized using a variant of the \u201cdropout\u201d technique. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of both heterogeneous pooling and dropout regularization. On the TIMIT phonetic recognition task, we have achieved an 18.7% phone error rate, lowest on this standard task reported in the literature with a single system and with no use of information about speaker identity. Preliminary experiments on large vocabulary speech recognition in a voice search task also show error rate reduction using heterogeneous pooling in the deep convolutional neural network."

On the first dataset, the pretrained ANN/HMM system outperforms the best Gaussian Mixture Model Hidden Markov Model (GMM/HMM) baseline, built with a much larger dataset by 3.7% absolute WER, while on the second dataset, it outperforms the GMM/HMM baseline by 4.7% absolute. Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) fine tuning and model combination using Segmental Conditional Random Fields (SCARF) give additional gains of 0.1% and 0.4% on the first dataset and 0.5% and 0.9% absolute on the second dataset."

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin.

Discovering this recursive structure helps us to not only identify the units that an image or sentence contains but also how they interact to form a whole. We introduce a max-margin structure prediction architecture based on recursive neural networks that can successfully recover such structure both in complex scene images as well as sentences. The same algorithm can be used both to provide a competitive syntactic parser for natural language sentences from the Penn Treebank and to outperform alternative approaches for semantic scene segmentation, annotation and classification. For segmentation and annotation our algorithm obtains a new level of state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford background dataset (78.1%). The features from the image parse tree outperform Gist descriptors for scene classification by 4%."

In particular, frequency-based heuristics have been proposed to improve the speed of recurrent neural network language models (RNN-LMs). In this paper, we present a dynamic programming algorithm for determining classes in a way that provably minimizes the runtime of the resulting class-based language models. However, we also find that the speed-based methods degrade the perplexity of the language models by 5-10% over traditional likelihood-based classing. We remedy this via the introduction of a speed-based regularization term in the likelihood objective function. This achieves a runtime close to that of the speed based methods without loss in perplexity performance. We demonstrate these improvements with both an RNN-LM and the Model M exponential language model, for three different tasks involving two different languages."

While sparse coding has become an increasingly popular method for learning visual features, it is most often trained at the patch level. Applying the resulting filters convolutionally results in highly redundant codes because overlapping patches are encoded in isolation. By training convolutionally over large image windows, our method reduces the redudancy between feature vectors at neighboring locations and improves the efficiency of the overall representation. In addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features, our method trains an efficient feed-forward encoder that predicts quasi-sparse features from the input. While patch-based training rarely produces anything but oriented edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse filters, including center-surround filters, corner detectors, cross detectors, and oriented grating detectors. We show that using these filters in multistage convolutional network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and detection tasks."

DNN trained on digits are perfectly capable of recognizing uppercase letters with minimal retraining. They are on par with DNN fully trained on uppercase letters, but train much faster. DNN trained on Chinese characters easily recognize uppercase Latin letters. Learning Chinese characters is accelerated by first pretraining a DNN on a small subset of all classes and then continuing to train on all classes. Furthermore, pretrained nets consistently outperform randomly initialized nets on new tasks with few labeled data."

The neural network which was first developed for spatial patterns was thus generalized for spatio-temporal patterns.

                "text": "Algorithmic, or automatic, differentiation (AD) is a growing area of theoretical research and software development concerned with the accurate and efficient evaluation of derivatives for function evaluations given as computer programs. The resulting derivative values are useful for all scientific computations that are based on linear, quadratic, or higher order approximations to nonlinear scalar or vector functions. AD has been applied in particular to optimization, parameter identification, nonlinear equation solving, the numerical integration of differential equations, and combinations of these. Apart from quantifying sensitivities numerically, AD also yields structural dependence information, such as the sparsity pattern and generic rank of Jacobian matrices. The field opens up an exciting opportunity to develop new algorithms that reflect the true cost of accurate derivatives and to use them for improvements in speed and reliability. This second edition has been updated and expanded to cover recent developments in applications and theory, including an elegant NP completeness argument by Uwe Naumann and a brief introduction to scarcity, a generalization of sparsity. There is also added material on checkpointing and iterative differentiation. To improve readability the more detailed analysis of memory and complexity bounds has been relegated to separate, optional chapters.The book consists of three parts: a stand-alone introduction to the fundamentals of AD and its software; a thorough treatment of methods for sparse problems; and final chapters on program-reversal schedules, higher derivatives, nonsmooth problems and iterative processes. Each of the 15 chapters concludes with examples and exercises. Audience: This volume will be valuable to designers of algorithms and software for nonlinear computational problems. Current numerical software users should gain the insight necessary to choose and deploy existing AD software tools to the best advantage.

This graph has a sum of products form; the new algorithm computes a factorization of this derivative graph along with an efficient grouping of product terms into subexpressions. For the problems in our test suite D* generates symbolic derivatives which are up to 4.6 x 103 times faster than those computed by the symbolic math program Mathematica and up to 2.2x105 times faster than the non-symbolic automatic differentiation program CppAD. In some cases the D* derivatives rival the best manually derived solutions."

Automatic Differentiation (AD) techniques augment the program with derivative computation by applying the chain rule of calculus to elementary operations in an automated fashion. This article introduces ADIC (Automatic Differentiation of C), a new AD tool for ANSI-C programs. ADIC is currently the only tool for ANSI-C that employs a source-to-source program transformation approach; that is, it takes a C code and produces a new C code that computes the original results as well as the derivatives. We first present ADIC \u2018by example\u2019 to illustrate the functionality and ease of use of ADIC and then describe in detail the architecture of ADIC. ADIC incorporates a modular design that provides a foundation for both rapid prototyping of better AD algorithms and their sharing across AD tools for different languages. A component architecture called AIF (Automatic Differentiation Intermediate Form) separates core AD concepts from their language-specific implementation and allows the development of generic AD modules that can be reused directly in other AIF-based AD tools. The language-specific ADIC front-end and back-end canonicalize C programs to make them fit for semantic augmentation and manage, for example, the association of a program variable with its derivative object. We also report on applications of ADIC to a semiconductor device simulator, 3-D CFD grid generator, vehicle simulator, and neural network code. \u00a9 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The basis of this book is the material contained in the first six chapters of our earlier work, The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms. We have expanded that coverage and have added material on algorithms for external storage and memory management. As a consequence, this book should be suitable as a text for a first course on data structures and algorithms. The only prerequisite we assume is familiarity with some high-level programming language such as Pascal."
