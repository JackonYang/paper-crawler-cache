                "text": "Machine-Learning tasks are becoming pervasive in a broad range of domains, and in a broad range of systems (from embedded systems to data centers). At the same time, a small set of machine-learning algorithms (especially Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks, i.e., CNNs and DNNs) are proving to be state-of-the-art across many applications. As architectures evolve towards heterogeneous multi-cores composed of a mix of cores and accelerators, a machine-learning accelerator can achieve the rare combination of efficiency (due to the small number of target algorithms) and broad application scope. Until now, most machine-learning accelerator designs have focused on efficiently implementing the computational part of the algorithms. However, recent state-of-the-art CNNs and DNNs are characterized by their large size. In this study, we design an accelerator for large-scale CNNs and DNNs, with a special emphasis on the impact of memory on accelerator design, performance and energy. We show that it is possible to design an accelerator with a high throughput, capable of performing 452 GOP/s (key NN operations such as synaptic weight multiplications and neurons outputs additions) in a small footprint of 3.02 mm2 and 485 mW; compared to a 128-bit 2GHz SIMD processor, the accelerator is 117.87x faster, and it can reduce the total energy by 21.08x. The accelerator characteristics are obtained after layout at 65 nm. Such a high throughput in a small footprint can open up the usage of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in a broad set of systems and for a broad set of applications."

The sheer size of these networks can represent a challenging computational burden, even for modern CPUs. For this reason, GPUs are routinely used instead to train and run such networks. This paper is a tutorial for students and researchers on some of the techniques that can be used to reduce this computational cost considerably on modern x86 CPUs. We emphasize data layout, batching of the computation, the use of SSE2 instructions, and particularly leverage SSSE3 and SSE4 fixed-point instructions which provide a 3\u00d7 improvement over an optimized floating-point baseline. We use speech recognition as an example task, and show that a real-time hybrid hidden Markov model / neural network (HMM/NN) large vocabulary system can be built with a 10\u00d7 speedup over an unoptimized baseline and a 4\u00d7 speedup over an aggressively optimized floating-point baseline at no cost in accuracy. The techniques described extend readily to neural network training and provide an effective alternative to the use of specialized hardware."

                "text": "Applications that use learning and classification algorithms operate on large amounts of unstructured data, and have stringent performance constraints. For such applications, the performance of general purpose processors scales poorly with data size because of their limited support for fine-grained parallelism and absence of software-managed caches. The large intermediate data in these applications also limits achievable performance on many-core processors such as GPUs. To accelerate such learning applications, we present a programmable accelerator that can execute multiple learning and classification algorithms. To architect such an accelerator, we profile five representative workloads, and find that their computationally intensive portions can be formulated as matrix or vector operations generating large amounts of intermediate data, which are then reduced by a secondary operation such as array ranking, finding max/min and aggregation. Our proposed accelerator, called MAPLE, has hundreds of simple processing elements (PEs) laid out in a two-dimensional grid, with two key features. First, it uses dynamic in-memory processing where on-chip memory blocks perform the secondary reduction operations. Second, MAPLE uses banked off-chip memory, and organizes its PEs into independent groups each with its own off-chip memory bank. These two features allow MAPLE to scale its performance with data size. We also present an Atom based energy-efficient heterogeneous system with MAPLE as the accelerator that satisfies the application\u2019s performance requirements at a lower system power. This article describes the MAPLE architecture, explores its design space with a simulator, illustrates how to automatically map application kernels to the hardware, and presents its performance improvement and energy benefits over classic server-based implementations. We implement a 512-PE FPGA prototype of MAPLE and find that it is 1.5-10x faster than a 2.5 GHz quad-core Xeon processor despite running at a modest 125 MHz clock rate. With MAPLE connected to a 1.6GHz dual-core Atom, we show an energy improvement of 38-84% over the Xeon server coupled to a 1.3 GHz 240 core Tesla GPU."

Recent efforts to train extremely large networks (with over 1 billion parameters) have relied on cloudlike computing infrastructure and thousands of CPU cores. In this paper, we present technical details and results from our own system based on Commodity Off-The-Shelf High Performance Computing (COTS HPC) technology: a cluster of GPU servers with Infiniband interconnects and MPI. Our system is able to train 1 billion parameter networks on just 3 machines in a couple of days, and we show that it can scale to networks with over 11 billion parameters using just 16 machines. As this infrastructure is much more easily marshaled by others, the approach enables much wider-spread research with extremely large neural networks."

To this end, we fabricated a key building block of a modular neuromorphic architecture, a neurosynaptic core, with 256 digital integrate-and-fire neurons and a 1024\u00d7256 bit SRAM crossbar memory for synapses using IBM's 45nm SOI process. Our fully digital implementation is able to leverage favorable CMOS scaling trends, while ensuring one-to-one correspondence between hardware and software. In contrast to a conventional von Neumann architecture, our core tightly integrates computation (neurons) alongside memory (synapses), which allows us to implement efficient fan-out (communication) in a naturally parallel and event-driven manner, leading to ultra-low active power consumption of 45pJ/spike. The core is fully configurable in terms of neuron parameters, axon types, and synapse states and is thus amenable to a wide range of applications. As an example, we trained a restricted Boltzmann machine offline to perform a visual digit recognition task, and mapped the learned weights to our chip."

Most custom circuits are highly defect sensitive, a single transistor can wreck such circuits. On the contrary, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are inherently error tolerant algorithms. And the emergence of high-performance applications implementing recognition and mining tasks, for which competitive ANN-based algorithms exist, drastically expands the potential application scope of a hardware ANN accelerator. However, while the error tolerance of ANN algorithms is well documented, there are few in-depth attempts at demonstrating that an actual hardware ANN would be tolerant to faulty transistors. Most fault models are abstract and cannot demonstrate that the error tolerance of ANN algorithms can be translated into the defect tolerance of hardware ANN accelerators. In this article, we introduce a hardware ANN geared towards defect tolerance and energy efficiency, by spatially expanding the ANN. In order to precisely assess the defect tolerance capability of this hardware ANN, we introduce defects at the level of transistors, and then assess the impact of such defects on the hardware ANN functional behavior. We empirically show that the conceptual error tolerance of neural networks does translate into the defect tolerance of hardware neural networks, paving the way for their introduction in heterogeneous multi-cores as intrinsically defect-tolerant and energy-efficient accelerators."

This paper explores the sources of these performance and energy overheads in general-purpose processing systems by quantifying the overheads of a 720p HD H.264 encoder running on a general-purpose CMP system. It then explores methods to eliminate these overheads by transforming the CPU into a specialized system for H.264 encoding. We evaluate the gains from customizations useful to broad classes of algorithms, such as SIMD units, as well as those specific to particular computation, such as customized storage and functional units. The ASIC is 500x more energy efficient than our original four-processor CMP. Broadly applicable optimizations improve performance by 10x and energy by 7x. However, the very low energy costs of actual core ops (100s fJ in 90nm) mean that over 90% of the energy used in these solutions is still \"overhead\". Achieving ASIC-like performance and efficiency requires algorithm-specific optimizations. For each sub-algorithm of H.264, we create a large, specialized functional unit that is capable of executing 100s of operations per instruction. This improves performance and energy by an additional 25x and the final customized CMP matches an ASIC solution's performance within 3x of its energy and within comparable area."

In this paper we describe some of the features that permit SpiNNaker chips to be connected together to form scalable massively-parallel systems. Our eventual goal is to be able to simulate neural networks consisting of 109 neurons running in dasiareal timepsila, by which we mean that a similarly sized collection of biological neurons would run at the same speed. In this paper we describe the methods by which neural networks are mapped onto the system, and how features designed into the chip are to be exploited in practice. We will also describe the modelling and verification activities by which we hope to ensure that, when the chip is delivered, it will work as anticipated."

In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service. Although we focus on and report performance of these methods as applied to training large neural networks, the underlying algorithms are applicable to any gradient-based machine learning algorithm."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

A range of hardware implementations is available to deliver computation with varying degrees of area and power efficiency, from general-purpose processors to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The tradeoff of moving towards more efficient customized solutions such as ASICs is the lack of flexibility in terms of hardware reusability and programmability. In this paper, we propose a customized semi-programmable loop accelerator architecture that exploits the efficiency gains available through high levels of customization, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to execute multiple similar loops. A customized instance of the loop accelerator architecture is generated for a particular loop and then the data and control paths are proactively generalized in an efficient manner to increase flexibility. A compiler mapping phase is then able to map other loops onto the same hardware. The efficiency of the programmable accelerator is compared with non-programmable accelerators and with the OpenRISC 1200 general purpose processor. The programmable accelerator is able to achieve up to 34x better power efficiency and 30x better area efficiency than a simple general purpose processor, while trading off as little as 2x power and area efficiency to the non-programmable accelerator."

                "text": "The desire to create novel computing systems, paired with recent advances in neuroscientific understanding of the brain, has led researchers to develop neuromorphic architectures that emulate the brain. To date, such models are developed, trained, and deployed on the same substrate. However, excessive co-dependence between the substrate and the algorithm prevents portability, or at the very least requires reconstructing and retraining the model whenever the substrate changes. This paper proposes a well-defined abstraction layer -- the Neuromorphic instruction set architecture, or NISA -- that separates a neural application's algorithmic specification from the underlying execution substrate, and describes the Aivo framework, which demonstrates the concrete advantages of such an abstraction layer. Aivo consists of a NISA implementation for a rate-encoded neuromorphic system based on the cortical column abstraction, a state-of-the-art integrated development and runtime environment (IDE), and various profile-based optimization tools. Aivo's IDE generates code for emulating cortical networks on the host CPU, multiple GPGPUs, or as boolean functions. Its runtime system can deploy and adaptively optimize cortical networks in a manner similar to conventional just-in-time compilers in managed runtime systems (e.g. Java, C#).\n We demonstrate the abilities of the NISA abstraction by constructing a cortical network model of the mammalian visual cortex, deploying on multiple execution substrates, and utilizing the various optimization tools we have created. For this hierarchical configuration, Aivo's profiling based network optimization tools reduce the memory footprint by 50% and improve the execution time by a factor of 3x on the host CPU. Deploying the same network on a single GPGPU results in a 30x speedup. We further demonstrate that a speedup of 480x can be achieved by deploying a massively scaled cortical network across three GPGPUs. Finally, converting a trained hierarchical network to C/C++ boolean constructs on the host CPU results in 44x speedup."

Beyond energy, the growing number of faults steers accelerator research towards fault-tolerant accelerators. In this article, we investigate a fault-tolerant and energy-efficient accelerator for signal processing applications. We depart from traditional designs by introducing an accelerator which relies on unary coding, a concept which is well adapted to the continuous real-world inputs of signal processing applications. Unary coding enables a number of atypical micro-architecture choices which bring down area cost and energy; moreover, unary coding provides graceful output degradation as the amount of transient faults increases. We introduce a configurable hybrid digital/analog micro-architecture capable of implementing a broad set of signal processing applications based on these concepts, together with a back-end optimizer which takes advantage of the special nature of these applications. For a set of five signal applications, we explore the different design tradeoffs and obtain an accelerator with an area cost of 1.63mm2. On average, this accelerator requires only 2.3% of the energy of an Atom-like core to implement similar tasks. We then evaluate the accelerator resilience to transient faults, and its ability to trade accuracy for energy savings."

We observe that specialized units achieve most of their efficiency gains by tuning data storage and compute structures and their connectivity to the data-flow and data-locality patterns in the kernels. Hence, by identifying key data-flow patterns used in a domain, we can create efficient engines that can be programmed and reused across a wide range of applications. We present an example, the Convolution Engine (CE), specialized for the convolution-like data-flow that is common in computational photography, image processing, and video processing applications. CE achieves energy efficiency by capturing data reuse patterns, eliminating data transfer overheads, and enabling a large number of operations per memory access. We quantify the tradeoffs in efficiency and flexibility and demonstrate that CE is within a factor of 2-3x of the energy and area efficiency of custom units optimized for a single kernel. CE improves energy and area efficiency by 8-15x over a SIMD engine for most applications."

Our biologically plausible, wide and deep artificial neural network architectures can. Small (often minimal) receptive fields of convolutional winner-take-all neurons yield large network depth, resulting in roughly as many sparsely connected neural layers as found in mammals between retina and visual cortex. Only winner neurons are trained. Several deep neural columns become experts on inputs preprocessed in different ways; their predictions are averaged. Graphics cards allow for fast training. On the very competitive MNIST handwriting benchmark, our method is the first to achieve near-human performance. On a traffic sign recognition benchmark it outperforms humans by a factor of two. We also improve the state-of-the-art on a plethora of common image classification benchmarks."

For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200\u00d7200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting from these learned features, we trained our network to recognize 22,000 object categories from ImageNet and achieve a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art."

This system was designed with the goal of providing real-time detection, categorization and localization of objects in complex scenes, while consuming 10 Watts when implemented on a Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA platform, or about ten times less than a laptop computer, and producing speedups of up to 100 times in real-world applications.

Since its introduction in the 1970s, the DRAM technology has been driven by cost while the logic technology has been driven by speed, leading to an ever-widening gap between slower memory and faster logic devices. That has led to the need for increasingly complex levels of memory hierarchies, resulting in considerable degradation of system performance despite many design and architecture compromises. DRAM can provide six to eight times as much memory as SRAM (static random access memory) in the same area, but has been too slow to be used at any cache level. Our studies, highlighted in this paper, indicated that the use of logic-based DRAM could resolve that difficulty--and was necessary for integrating systems on a chip. This has led to the inclusion of logic-based eDRAM as a memory option in the IBM ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) product."

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks. A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Therefore, binary128 arithmetic is now required to increase the accuracy and reliability of these computations. At the same time, an obvious trend emerging in modern processors is to extend their instruction sets by allowing single instruction multiple data (SIMD) execution, which can significantly accelerate the data-parallel applications. To address the combined demands mentioned above, this paper presents the architecture of a low-cost binary128 floating-point fused multiply add (FMA) unit with SIMD support. The proposed FMA design can execute a binary128 FMA every other cycle with a latency of four cycles, or two binary64 FMAs fully pipelined with a latency of three cycles, or four binary32 FMAs fully pipelined with a latency of three cycles. We use two binary64 FMA units to support binary128 FMA which requires much less hardware than a fully pipelined binary128 FMA. The presented binary128 FMA design uses both segmentation and iteration hardware vectorization methods to trade off performance, such as throughput and latency, against area and power. Compared with a standard binary128 FMA implementation, the proposed FMA design has 30 percent less area and 29 percent less dynamic power dissipation."

These brain-like architectures, which are premised on our understanding of how the human neocortex computes, are highly fault-tolerant, averaging results over large numbers of potentially faulty components, yet manage to solve very difficult problems more reliably than traditional algorithms. A key principle of operation for these architectures is that of automatic abstraction: independent features are extracted from highly disordered inputs and are used to create abstract invariant representations of the external entities. This feature extraction is applied hierarchically, leading to increasing levels of abstraction at higher levels in the hierarchy. This paper describes and evaluates a biologically plausible computational model for this process, and highlights the inherent fault tolerance of the biologically-inspired algorithm. We introduce a stuck-at fault model for such cortical networks, and describe how this model maps to hardware faults that can occur on commodity GPGPU cores used to realize the model in software. We show experimentally that the model software implementation can intrinsically preserve its functionality in the presence of faulty hardware, without requiring any reprogramming or recompilation. This model is a first step towards developing a comprehensive and biologically plausible understanding of the computational algorithms and microarchitecture of computing systems that mimic the human cortex, and to applying them to the robust implementation of tasks on future computing systems built of faulty components."

The presented VLSI implementation includes continuous-time analog neurons with up to 16 k inputs. A novel interconnection and routing scheme allows the mapping of a multitude of network models derived from biology on the VLSI neural network while maintaining a high resource usage. A single 20 cm wafer contains about 60 million synapses. The implemented neurons are highly accelerated compared to biological real time. The power consumption of the dense interconnection network providing the necessary communication bandwidth is a critical aspect of the system integration. A novel asynchronous low-voltage signaling scheme is presented that makes the wafer-scale approach feasible by limiting the total power consumption while simultaneously providing a flexible, programmable network topology."

Data-dependent statistics are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and data-independent statistics are estimated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of statistic that enter into the gradient of the log likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer pretraining phase that initializes the weights sensibly. The pretraining also allows the variational inference to be initialized sensibly with a single bottom-up pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB data sets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn very good generative models of handwritten digits and 3D objects. We also show that the features discovered by deep Boltzmann machines are a very effective way to initialize the hidden layers of feedforward neural nets, which are then discriminatively fine-tuned."

Deep neural nets have also achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random \u201cdropout\u201d procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU) non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that modified deep neural networks using ReLUs trained with dropout during frame level training provide an 4.2% relative improvement over a DNN trained with sigmoid units, and a 14.4% relative improvement over a strong GMM/HMM system. We were able to obtain our results with minimal human hyper-parameter tuning using publicly available Bayesian optimization code."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

We also describe the technology advancements required to scale the deep trench as well as the access transistor for optimal cell retention and performance.

In 2011, the open-domain question-answering (QA) system, dubbed Watson, beat the two highest ranked players in a nationally televised two-game Jeopardy! match. This paper provides a brief history of the events and ideas that positioned our team to take on the Jeopardy! challenge, build Watson, IBM Watson\u2122, and ultimately triumph. It describes both the nature of the QA challenge represented by Jeopardy! and our overarching technical approach. The main body of this paper provides a narrative of the DeepQA processing pipeline to introduce the articles in this special issue and put them in context of the overall system. Finally, this paper summarizes our main results, describing how the system, as a holistic combination of many diverse algorithmic techniques, performed at champion levels, and it briefly discusses the team's future research plans."

                "text": "In many recent object recognition systems, feature extraction stages are generally composed of a filter bank, a non-linear transformation, and some sort of feature pooling layer. Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (\u226b 65%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%)."

Given the constant chip-level power budgets, this exponentially decreases the percentage of transistors that can switch at full frequency with each technology generation. Hence, while the transistor budget continues to increase exponentially, the power budget has become the dominant limiting factor in processor design. In this regime, utilizing transistors to design specialized cores that optimize energy-per-computation becomes an effective approach to improve system performance."

This eDRAM memory features an HKMG CMOS compatible (low-thermal low-charging process) high-K MIM capacitor with extreme low leakage (&#60;0.1fA/cell). Access transistor with HKMG shows excellent driving capability (>50uA/cell) with &#60;1fA/cell leakage in 28nm cell and &#60;3fA/cell in 20nm cell (0.021um2). We demonstrate first functional silicon success of 28nm eDRAM macro. 600/550 MHz operating frequency is achieved at typical/worse cases."

We present a self-supervised learning process for long-range vision that is able to accurately classify complex terrain at distances up to the horizon, thus allowing superior strategic planning. The success of the learning process is due to the self-supervised training data that are generated on every frame: robust, visually consistent labels from a stereo module; normalized wide-context input windows; and a discriminative and concise feature representation. A deep hierarchical network is trained to extract informative and meaningful features from an input image, and the features are used to train a real-time classifier to predict traversability. The trained classifier sees obstacles and paths from 5 to more than 100 m, far beyond the maximum stereo range of 12 m, and adapts very quickly to new environments. The process was developed and tested on the LAGR (Learning Applied to Ground Robots) mobile robot. Results from a ground truth data set, as well as field test results, are given. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

In this study we strive to develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them. The proposed deep structured semantic models are discriminatively trained by maximizing the conditional likelihood of the clicked documents given a query using the clickthrough data. To make our models applicable to large-scale Web search applications, we also use a technique called word hashing, which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks. The new models are evaluated on a Web document ranking task using a real-world data set. Results show that our best model significantly outperforms other latent semantic models, which were considered state-of-the-art in the performance prior to the work presented in this paper."

We present a self\u2010supervised learning process for long\u2010range vision that is able to accurately classify complex terrain at distances up to the horizon, thus allowing superior strategic planning. The success of the learning process is due to the self\u2010supervised training data that are generated on every frame: robust, visually consistent labels from a stereo module; normalized wide\u2010context input windows; and a discriminative and concise feature representation. A deep hierarchical network is trained to extract informative and meaningful features from an input image, and the features are used to train a real\u2010time classifier to predict traversability. The trained classifier sees obstacles and paths from 5 to more than 100 m, far beyond the maximum stereo range of 12 m, and adapts very quickly to new environments. The process was developed and tested on the LAGR (Learning Applied to Ground Robots) mobile robot. Results from a ground truth data set, as well as field test results, are given. \u00a9 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

This model has been widely investigated both for the uplink (UTs to CP) and for the downlink (CP to UTs), which are instances of the general multiple-access relay and broadcast relay networks. We contribute to the subject in the following ways: 1) For the uplink, we consider the recently proposed \u201ccompute and forward\u201d (CoF) approach and examine the corresponding system optimization at finite SNR. 2) For the downlink, we propose a novel precoding scheme nicknamed \u201creverse compute and forward\u201d (RCoF). 3) In both cases, we present low-complexity versions of CoF and RCoF based on standard scalar quantization at the receivers, that lead to discrete-input discrete-output symmetric memoryless channel models for which near-optimal performance can be achieved by standard single-user linear coding. 4) We provide extensive numerical results and finite SNR comparison with other \u201cstate of the art\u201d information theoretic techniques, in scenarios including fading and shadowing. The proposed uplink and downlink system optimization focuses specifically on the ATs and UTs selection problem. In both cases, for a given set of transmitters, the goal consists of selecting a subset of the receivers such that the corresponding system matrix has full rank and the sum rate is maximized. We present low-complexity ATs and UTs selection schemes and demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulation that the proposed schemes essentially eliminate the problem of rank deficiency of the system matrix and greatly mitigate the noninteger penalty affecting CoF/RCoF at high SNR. Comparison with other state-of-the art information theoretic schemes, show competitive performance of the proposed approaches with significantly lower complexity."

                "text": "One of the greatest challenges faced by designers of digital systems is optimizing the communication and interconnection between system components. Interconnection networks offer an attractive and economical solution to this communication crisis and are fast becoming pervasive in digital systems. Current trends suggest that this communication bottleneck will be even more problematic when designing future generations of machines. Consequently, the anatomy of an interconnection network router and science of interconnection network design will only grow in importance in the coming years. \n \nThis book offers a detailed and comprehensive presentation of the basic principles of interconnection network design, clearly illustrating them with numerous examples, chapter exercises, and case studies. It incorporates hardware-level descriptions of concepts, allowing a designer to see all the steps of the process from abstract design to concrete implementation. \n \n\u00b7Case studies throughout the book draw on extensive author experience in designing interconnection networks over a period of more than twenty years, providing real world examples of what works, and what doesn't. \n \n\u00b7Tightly couples concepts with implementation costs to facilitate a deeper understanding of the tradeoffs in the design of a practical network. \n \n\u00b7A set of examples and exercises in every chapter help the reader to fully understand all the implications of every design decision. \n \nTable of Contents \n \n \nChapter 1 Introduction to Interconnection Networks \n1.1 Three Questions
