This new image benchmark (referred to as IAPR Benchmark), has grown out of an initiative started by the International Association of Pattern Recognition (IAPR) and consists of approximately 25,000 images from a personal photographic collection provided by the lead author. The construction and composition of this unique image collection are described in this paper, together with information on expected use of this image collection in future ImageCLEF tasks."

The only dataset used by a large number of research groups are the Corel Photo CDs. There are more than 800 of those CDs, each containing 100 pictures roughly similar in theme. Unfortunately, basically every evaluation is done on a different subset of the image sets thus making comparison impossible.In this article, we compare different ways of evaluating the performance using a subset of the Corel images with the same CBIRSan d the same set of evaluation measures. The aim is to show how easy it is to get differing results, even when using the same image collection, the same CBIRS and the same performance measures. This pinpoints the fact that we need a standard database of images with a query set and corresponding relevance judgments (RJs) to really compare systems.The techniques used in this article to \"enhance\" the apparent performance of a CBIRSa re commonly used, sometimes described, sometimes not. They all have a justification and seem to change the performance of a CBIRS but they do actually not. With a larger subset of images it is of course much easier to generate even bigger differences in performance. The goal of this article is not to be a guide of how to make the \"apparent\" performance of systems look good, but rather to make readers aware of CBIRS evaluations and the importance of standardized image databases, queries and RJ."

Unfortunately, we have very little evidence of the usefulness of these algorithms in real user needs and contexts. In this paper, we introduce a test collection for the evaluation of CBIR algorithms. In the test collection, the performance testing is based on photograph similarity perceived by end-users in the context of realistic illustration tasks and environment. The building process and the characteristics of the resulting test collection are outlined, including a typology of similarity criteria expressed by the subjects judging the similarity of photographs. A small-scale study on the consistency of similarity assessments is presented. A case evaluation of two CBIR algorithms is reported. The results show clear correlation between the subjects' similarity assessments and the functioning of feature parameters of the tested algorithms."

Now beginning its fourth year, TRECVID aims over time to develop both a better understanding of how systems can effectively accomplish video retrieval and how one can reliably benchmark their performance. This paper is a case study in the development of video retrieval systems and their evaluation as well as a report on the TRECVID status to-date. After an introduction to the evolution of TRECVID over the past 3 years, we report on the most recent evaluation TRECVID 2003 in terms of the 4 tasks (shot boundary determination, high-level feature extraction, story segmentation and classification, search), the data (133 hours of US television news), the measures, the results obtained, and the approaches taken by some of the 24 participating groups."

While different systems clearly have their particular strengths, they tend to use different collections to highlight the advantages of their algorithms. Consequently, a degree of bias may exist, and it also makes it difficult to make comparisons concerning the relative superiority of different algorithms. In order for the field of visual information search to make further progress, a need therefore exists for a standardised benchmark suite to be developed. By having a uniform measure of search performance, research progress can be more easily recognised and charted, and the resultant synergy will be essential to further development of the field. This paper presents concrete proposals concerning the development of such a benchmark, and by adopting an extensible framework, it is able to cater for a wide variety of applications paradigms and to lend itself to incremental refinement."

Users can given voice to their reactions to images-how well they suit needs. User-generated reactions might provide word-based descriptors helpful to subsequent users and requiring minimal system resources to produce. Shifting focus from description of documents to description of reactions is accomplished by gathering verbal captions and responses to images. User generation of captions and verbal responses within a collection of 300 diverse images is demonstrated and analyzed. Functional adjectival descriptors appear in 20% of the responses and functional narrative (conversational) descriptors appear in 80% of the responses. Issues of larger scale analysis, implementation, and possible shifts in understanding of representation for retrieval are discussed."

This structure makes it easy to implement a collection's descriptions as a relational database, enabling efficient search via the application of well-developed database-indexing methods. Description components may be elements from external resources (thesaurus, ontology, database, or knowledge base). This provides a rich superstructure for the meaningful retrieval of images by their semantic contents."
