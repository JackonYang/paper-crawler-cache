The task involved identifying the phonetic content of an unknown utterance only from a visual examination of the spectrogram. In the first experiment, one of the authors attempted to phonetically label spectrograms of normal and anomalous English utterances as well as words in a known carrier phrase. The results, when compared with the transcriptions of three phoneticians who listened to the utterances, indicated an overall agreement of better than 85% on the sentences, and 93% for words in a carrier phrase. In the second and third experiments, we investigated the speed at which spectrogram reading can be accomplished. In the final experiment, five students read spectrograms of normal English sentences after a 13-week course in acoustic phonetics. Working as a group, the class agreed with the transcribers on over 80% of the segments. Implications for speech recognition and aids for the deaf are discussed."

There is another class of recognizer which further processes these frames to produce a segment-based network, and represents each segment by fixed-dimensional \"features\". In such feature-based recognizers, the observation space takes the form of a temporal network of feature vectors, so that a single segmentation of an utterance uses a subset of all possible feature vectors. In this paper, we examine a maximum a-posteriori decoding strategy for feature-based recognizers and develop a normalization criterion that is useful for a segment-based Viterbi or A* search. We report experimental results for the task of phonetic recognition on the TIMIT corpus, where we achieved context-independent and context-dependent (using diphones) results on the core test set of 64.1% and 69.5% respectively."

First, heterogeneous acoustic measurements are chosen in order to maximize the acoustic-phonetic information extracted from the speech signal in preprocessing. Second, classifier systems are presented for successfully utilizing high-dimensional acoustic measurement spaces. The techniques used for achieving these two goals can be broadly categorized as hierarchical, committeebased, or a hybrid of these two. This paper presents committeebased and hybrid approaches. In context-independent classification and context-dependent recognition on the TIMIT core test set using 39 classes, the system achieved error rates of 18.3% and 24.4%, respectively. These error rates are the lowest we have seen reported on these tasks. In addition, experiments with a telephone-based weather information word recognition task led to word error rate reductions of 10\u201316%."

Specifically, we compare two popular frameworks, based on conditional maximum likelihood (CML) and minimum classification error (MCE), to a new framework based on margin maximization. Unlike CML and MCE, our formulation of large margin training explicitly penalizes incorrect decodings by an amount proportional to the number of mislabeled hidden states. It also leads to a convex optimization over the parameter space of CD-HMMs, thus avoiding the problem of spurious local minima. We used discriminatively trained CD-HMMs from all three frameworks to build phonetic recognizers on the TIMIT speech corpus. The different recognizers employed exactly the same acoustic front end and hidden state space, thus enabling us to isolate the effect of different cost functions, parameterizations, and numerical optimizations. Experimentally, we find that our framework for large margin training yields significantly lower error rates than both CML and MCE training."

We propose a new method of phonediscriminating minimum classification error (P-MCE), which performs MCE training at the sub-string or phone level instead of at the traditional string level. Aiming at minimizing the phone recognition error rate, P-MCE nevertheless takes advantage of the well-known, efficient training routine derived from the conventional string-based MCE, using specially constructed one-best lists selected from phone lattices. Extensive investigations and comparisons are conducted between the PMCE and other discriminative training methods including maximum mutual information (MMI), minimum phone or word error (MPE/MWE), and the other two MCE methods. The P-MCE outperforms most of experimented approaches on the standard TIMIT database in terms of the continuous phonetic recognition accuracy. P-MCE achieves comparable results with the MPE method which also aims at reducing phone-level recognition errors."

The main characteristics of the phone recognizerare: high dimensional feature vector (48), contextand genderdependent phone models with duration distribution, continuous density HMM with Gaussian mixtures, and n-gram probabilities for the phonotatic constraints. These models are trained on speech data that have either phonetic or orthographic transcriptions using maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimation techniques. On the WSJ0 corpus with a 46 phone set we obtain phone accuraciesof 72.4% and 74.4% using 500 and 1600 CD phone units, respectively. Accuracy on BREF with 35 phones is as high as 78.7% with only 428 CD phone units. On TIMIT using the 61 phone symbols and only 500 CD phone units, we obtain a phone accuracyof 67.2% which correspond to 73.4% when the recognizer output is mapped to the commonly used 39 phone set. Making reference to our work on large vocabulary CSR, we show that it is worthwhile to perform phone recognition experiments as opposed to only focusing attention on word recognition results."

The formulation of this generalized HTM is presented in the generative-modeling framework, enabling efficient computation of the joint likelihood for both static and delta cepstral sequences as the acoustic features given the model. The parameter estimation techniques for the new model are developed and presented, giving closed-form estimation formulas after the use of vector Taylor series approximation. We show principled generalization from the earlier static-cepstra HTM to the new static/delta-cepstra HTM not only in terms of model formulations but also in terms of their respective analytical forms in (monophone) parameter estimation. Experimental results on the standard TIMIT phonetic recognition task demonstrate recognition accuracy improvement over the earlier best HTM system, both significantly better than state-of-the-art triphone HMM systems."

In particular, transformations that are trained in a maximum likelihood sense on adaptation data are investigated. Only model-based linear transforms are considered, since, for linear transforms, they subsume the appropriate feature\u2013space transforms. The paper compares the two possible forms of model-based transforms: (i) unconstrained, where any combination of mean and variance transform may be used, and (ii) constrained, which requires the variance transform to have the same form as the mean transform. Re-estimation formulae for all appropriate cases of transform are given. This includes a new and efficient full variance transform and the extension of the constrained model\u2013space transform from the simple diagonal case to the full or block\u2013diagonal case. The constrained and unconstrained transforms are evaluated in terms of computational cost, recognition time efficiency, and use for speaker adaptive training. The recognition performance of the two model\u2013space transforms on a large vocabulary speech recognition task using incremental adaptation is investigated. In addition, initial experiments using the constrained model\u2013space transform for speaker adaptive training are detailed."

The method is illustrated via an experiment to build a set of generalized triphone models for the TIMIT database in which triphones are constructed by joining together left and right dependent biphones. Although simple, the method results in good performance and avoids the need to train large numbers of triphones. The use of tying to increase model robustness is also investigated. Tying the center states within triphones of the same phoneme class and tying variances within states is beneficial, but larger-scale tying of variances leads to degraded performance.<<ETX>>"

In contrast, Gaussian mixture HMM systems are discriminatively trained using sequence-based criteria, such as minimum phone error or maximum mutual information, that are more directly related to speech recognition accuracy. This paper demonstrates that neural-network acoustic models can be trained with sequence classification criteria using exactly the same lattice-based methods that have been developed for Gaussian mixture HMMs, and that using a sequence classification criterion in training leads to considerably better performance. A neural network acoustic model with 153K weights trained on 50 hours of broadcast news has a word error rate of 34.0% on the rt04 English broadcast news test set. When this model is trained with the state-level minimum Bayes risk criterion, the rt04 word error rate is 27.7%."

The modification consists of boosting the likelihoods of paths in the denominator lattice that have a higher phone error relative to the correct transcript, by using the same phone accuracy function that is used in Minimum Phone Error (MPE) training. We combine this with another improvement to our implementation of the Extended Baum-Welch update equations for MMI, namely the canceling of any shared part of the numerator and denominator statistics on each frame (a procedure that is already done in MPE). This change affects the Gaussian-specific learning rate. We also investigate another modification whereby we replace I-smoothing to the ML estimate with I-smoothing to the previous iteration's value. Boosted MMI gives better results than MPE in both model and feature-space discriminative training, although not consistently."

The need for efficient exploitation of context information is discussed; a role for which the recurrent net appears suitable. An overview of early developments of recurrent nets for phone recognition is given along with the more recent improvements that include their integration with Markov models. Recognition results are presented for the DARPA TIMIT and Resource Management tasks, and it is concluded that recurrent nets are competitive with traditional means for performing phone probability estimation."
