After reviewing a variety of graphical models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl's (1986) belief propagation algorithm is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms for various codes, including \"turbo decoding\" of parallel-concatenated convolutional codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code. We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes, and low-density parity-check codes."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

Among the quasi-cyclic codes are the quadratic residue codes, Reed\u2013Solomon codes and optimal BCH codes. The constraint length K for the convolutional encoding of many of these codes (Golay, (48, 24) OR, etc.) turns out to be surprisingly small. Thus using the soft decoding techniques for convolutional decoding we now have a new maximum likelihood decoding algorithm for many block codes. Conversely an optimal quasi-cyclic code will yield a convolutional encoding with optimal local properties and therefore with good infinite convolutional coding properties."

Recently, a n umber of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same algorithms on networks with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. Here we l a y a foundation for an understanding of belief propagation in networks with loops. For networks with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the steady state beliefs in the loopy network and the true posterior probability. Using this relationship we show a category of networks for which the MAP estimate obtained by belief update and by belief revision can be proven to be optimal (although the beliefs will be incorrect). We s h o w h o w nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct the steady state beliefs. Furthermore we p r o ve that for all networks with a single loop, the MAP estimate obtained by belief revision at convergence is guaranteed to give the globally optimal sequence of states. The result is independent of the length of the cycle and the size of the state space. For networks with multiple loops, we i n troduce the concept of a \\balanced network\" and show simulation results comparing belief revision and update in such networks. We show t h a t t h e T urbo code structure is balanced and present simulations on a toy T urbo code problem indicating the decoding obtained by belief revision at convergence is signiicantly more likely to be correct.

Recently, a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same algorithms on networks with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. Here we lay the foundation for an understanding of belief propagation in networks with loops. For networks with a single loop, we derive ananalytical relationship between the steady state beliefs in the loopy network and the true posterior probability. Using this relationship we show a category of networks for which the MAP estimate obtained by belief update and by belief revision can be proven to be optimal(although the beliefs will be incorrect). We show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct the steady state beliefs. Furthermore we prove that for all networks with a single loop, the MAP estimate obtained by belief revisionat convergence is guaranteed to give the globally optimal sequence of states. The result is independent of the length of the cycle and the size of the statespace. For networks with multiple loops, we introduce the concept of a ``balanced network'''' and show simulati."
