Also, conventional networks fix the architecture before training starts; as a result, training cannot improve the architecture. To address these limitations, we describe a method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of 9x, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss. Similar experiments with VGG-16 found that the number of parameters can be reduced by 13x, from 138 million to 10.3 million, again with no loss of accuracy."

However, a very deep CNN generally involves many layers with millions of parameters, making the storage of the network model to be extremely large. This prohibits the usage of deep CNNs on resource limited hardware, especially cell phones or other embedded devices. In this paper, we tackle this model storage issue by investigating information theoretical vector quantization methods for compressing the parameters of CNNs. In particular, we have found in terms of compressing the most storage demanding dense connected layers, vector quantization methods have a clear gain over existing matrix factorization methods. Simply applying k-means clustering to the weights or conducting product quantization can lead to a very good balance between model size and recognition accuracy. For the 1000-category classification task in the ImageNet challenge, we are able to achieve 16-24 times compression of the network with only 1% loss of classification accuracy using the state-of-the-art CNN."

While custom hardware helps the computation, fetching weights from DRAM is two orders of magnitude more expensive than ALU operations, and dominates the required power. Previously proposed 'Deep Compression' makes it possible to fit large DNNs (AlexNet and VGGNet) fully in on-chip SRAM. This compression is achieved by pruning the redundant connections and having multiple connections share the same weight. We propose an energy efficient inference engine (EIE) that performs inference on this compressed network model and accelerates the resulting sparse matrix-vector multiplication with weight sharing. Going from DRAM to SRAM gives EIE 120x energy saving, Exploiting sparsity saves 10x, Weight sharing gives 8x, Skipping zero activations from ReLU saves another 3x. Evaluated on nine DNN benchmarks, EIE is 189x and 13x faster when compared to CPU and GPU implementations of the same DNN without compression. EIE has a processing power of 102 GOPS working directly on a compressed network, corresponding to 3 TOPS on an uncompressed network, and processes FC layers of AlexNet at 1.88x104 frames/sec with a power dissipation of only 600mW. It is 24,000x and 3,400x more energy efficient than a CPU and GPU respectively. Compared with DaDianNao, EIE has 2.9x, 19x and 3x better throughput, energy efficiency and area efficiency."

For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet). \nThe SqueezeNet architecture is available for download here: this https URL"

The learning capability of the network improves with increasing depth and size of each layer. However this capability comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. Thus reduction in hardware complexity and faster classification are highly desired. This work proposes an optimization method for fixed point deep convolutional neural networks. The parameters of a pre-trained high precision network are first directly quantized using L2 error minimization. We quantize each layer one by one, while other layers keep computation with high precision, to know the layer-wise sensitivity on word-length reduction. Then the network is retrained with quantized weights. Two examples on object recognition, MNIST and CIFAR-10, are presented. Our results indicate that quantization induces sparsity in the network which reduces the effective number of network parameters and improves generalization. This work reduces the required memory storage by a factor of 1/10 and achieves better classification results than the high precision networks."

These regularizers encourage that fewer connections in the convolution and fully connected layers take non-zero values and in effect result in sparse connectivity between hidden units in the deep network. This in turn reduces the memory and runtime cost involved in deploying the learned CNNs. We show that training with such regularization can still be performed using stochastic gradient descent implying that it can be used easily in existing codebases. Experimental evaluation of our approach on MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets shows that our regularizers can result in dramatic reductions in memory requirements. For instance, when applied on AlexNet, our method can reduce the memory consumption by a factor of four with minimal loss in accuracy."

We present a novel network architecture, HashedNets, that exploits inherent redundancy in neural networks to achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a low-cost hash function to randomly group connection weights into hash buckets, and all connections within the same hash bucket share a single parameter value. These parameters are tuned to adjust to the HashedNets weight sharing architecture with standard backprop during training. Our hashing procedure introduces no additional memory overhead, and we demonstrate on several benchmark data sets that HashedNets shrink the storage requirements of neural networks substantially while mostly preserving generalization performance."

The sheer size of these networks can represent a challenging computational burden, even for modern CPUs. For this reason, GPUs are routinely used instead to train and run such networks. This paper is a tutorial for students and researchers on some of the techniques that can be used to reduce this computational cost considerably on modern x86 CPUs. We emphasize data layout, batching of the computation, the use of SSE2 instructions, and particularly leverage SSSE3 and SSE4 fixed-point instructions which provide a 3\u00d7 improvement over an optimized floating-point baseline. We use speech recognition as an example task, and show that a real-time hybrid hidden Markov model / neural network (HMM/NN) large vocabulary system can be built with a 10\u00d7 speedup over an unoptimized baseline and a 4\u00d7 speedup over an aggressively optimized floating-point baseline at no cost in accuracy. The techniques described extend readily to neural network training and provide an effective alternative to the use of specialized hardware."

Reducing the number of parameters while preserving predictive performance is critically important for training big models in distributed systems and for deployment in embedded devices. In this paper, we introduce a novel Adaptive Fastfood transform to reparameterize the matrix-vector multiplication of fully connected layers. Reparameterizing a fully connected layer with d inputs and n outputs with the Adaptive Fastfood transform reduces the storage and computational costs costs from O(nd) to O(n) and O(n log d) respectively. Using the Adaptive Fastfood transform in convolutional networks results in what we call a deep fried convnet. These convnets are end-to-end trainable, and enable us to attain substantial reductions in the number of parameters without affecting prediction accuracy on the MNIST and ImageNet datasets."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets."

The framework is a BSD-licensed C++ library with Python and MATLAB bindings for training and deploying general-purpose convolutional neural networks and other deep models efficiently on commodity architectures. Caffe fits industry and internet-scale media needs by CUDA GPU computation, processing over 40 million images a day on a single K40 or Titan GPU (approx 2 ms per image). By separating model representation from actual implementation, Caffe allows experimentation and seamless switching among platforms for ease of development and deployment from prototyping machines to cloud environments. Caffe is maintained and developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) with the help of an active community of contributors on GitHub. It powers ongoing research projects, large-scale industrial applications, and startup prototypes in vision, speech, and multimedia."

By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

The hardware complexity can be much lowered by minimizing the word-length of weights and signals, but direct quantization for fixed-point network design does not yield good results. We optimize the fixed-point design by employing backpropagation based retraining. The designed fixed-point networks with ternary weights (+1, 0, and -1) and 3-bit signal show only negligible performance loss when compared to the floating-point coun-terparts. The backpropagation for retraining uses quantized weights and fixed-point signal to compute the output, but utilizes high precision values for adapting the networks.

These models deliver impressive accuracy, but each image evaluation requires millions of floating point operations, making their deployment on smartphones and Internet-scale clusters problematic. The computation is dominated by the convolution operations in the lower layers of the model. We exploit the redundancy present within the convolutional filters to derive approximations that significantly reduce the required computation. Using large state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate speedups of convolutional layers on both CPU and GPU by a factor of 2 x, while keeping the accuracy within 1% of the original model."

Our generative model is an n node multilayer network that has degree at most n\u03b3 for some \u03b3 < 1 and each edge has a random edge weight in [-1, 1]. Our algorithm learns almost all networks in this class with polynomial running time. The sample complexity is quadratic or cubic depending upon the details of the model. \n \nThe algorithm uses layerwise learning. It is based upon a novel idea of observing correlations among features and using these to infer the underlying edge structure via a global graph recovery procedure. The analysis of the algorithm reveals interesting structure of neural nets with random edge weights."

Various customized CNN accelerators on embedded FPGA or ASIC platforms have been designed to accelerate CNN and improve energy efficiency. However, the odd-number filter size in existing CNN models prevents hardware accelerators from having optimal efficiency. In this paper, we analyze the influences of filter size on CNN accelerator performance and show that even-number filter size is much more hardware-friendly that can ensure high bandwidth and resource utilization. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that hardware-friendly even kernel CNNs can reduce the FLOPs by 1.4\u00d7 to 2\u00d7 with comparable accuracy; With same FLOPs, even kernel can have even higher accuracy than odd size kernel."

Our method, Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), is Significantly better than magnitude-based methods and Optimal Brain Damage [Le Cun, Denker and Solla, 1990], which often remove the wrong weights. OBS permits the pruning of more weights than other methods (for the same error on the training set), and thus yields better generalization on test data. Crucial to OBS is a recursion relation for calculating the inverse Hessian matrix H-1 from training data and structural information of the net. OBS permits a 90%, a 76%, and a 62% reduction in weights over backpropagation with weight decay on three benchmark MONK's problems [Thrun et al., 1991]. Of OBS, Optimal Brain Damage, and magnitude-based methods, only OBS deletes the correct weights from a trained XOR network in every case. Finally, whereas Sejnowski and Rosenberg [1987] used 18,000 weights in their NETtalk network, we used OBS to prune a network to just 1560 weights, yielding better generalization."

An architecture combining time-delay windows and recurrent connections is used to capture the important dynamic information of the speech signal. Because the number of connections in a fully connected recurrent network grows super-linear with the number of hidden units, schemes for sparse connection and connection pruning are explored. It is found that sparsely connected networks outperform their fully connected counterparts with an equal number of connections. The implementation of the combined architecture and training scheme is described in detail . The networks are evaluated in a hybrid HMM/ANN system for phoneme recognition on the TIMIT database, and for word recognition on the WAXHOLM database. The achieved phone error-rate, 27.8%, for the standard 39 phoneme set on the core test-set of the TIMIT database is in the range of the lowest reported. All training and simulation software used is made freely available by the author, and detailed information about the software and the training process is given in an Appendix.

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called location-sensitive deep network LSDN for synthesizing images across domains. Our network integrates intensity feature from image voxels and spatial information in a principled manner. Specifically, LSDN models hidden nodes as products of features and spatial responses. We then propose a novel method, called ShrinkConnect, for reducing the computations of LSDN without sacrificing synthesis accuracy. ShrinkConnect enforces simultaneous sparsity to find a compact set of functions that accurately approximates the responses of all hidden nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that LSDN+ShrinkConnect outperforms the state of the art in cross-domain synthesis of MRI brain scans by a significant margin. Our approach is also computationally efficient, e.g. 26\u00d7 faster than other sparse representation based methods."

This approach can be used to (a) dynamically select the number of hidden units, (b) construct a representation that is appropriate for the problem and (c) thus improve the generalization ability of Back-propagation networks. The method Rumelhart suggests involves adding penalty terms to the usual error function. In this paper we introduce Rumelhart's minimal networks idea and compare two possible biases on the weight search space. These biases are compared in both simple counting problems and a speech recognition problem. In general, the constrained search does seem to minimize the number of hidden units required with an expected increase in local minima."

These transferable adversarial examples may severely hinder deep neural network-based applications. Previous works mostly study the transferability using small scale datasets. In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification system."

In this work, we introduce Neural Process Networks to understand procedural text through (neural) simulation of action dynamics. Our model complements existing memory architectures with dynamic entity tracking by explicitly modeling actions as state transformers. The model updates the states of the entities by executing learned action operators. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed model can reason about the unstated causal effects of actions, allowing it to provide more accurate contextual information for understanding and generating procedural text, all while offering more interpretable internal representations than existing alternatives."
