In a typical recommender system people provide recommendations as inputs, which the system then aggregates and directs to appropriate recipients. In some cases the primary transformation is in the aggregation; in others the system\u2019s value lies in its ability to make good matches between the recommenders and those seeking recommendations. The developers of the first recommender system, Tapestry [1], coined the phrase \u201ccollaborative filtering\u201d and several others have adopted it. We prefer the more general term \u201crecommender system\u201d for two reasons. First, recommenders may not explictly collaborate with recipients, who may be unknown to each other. Second, recommendations may suggest particularly interesting items, in addition to indicating those that should be filtered out. This special section includes descriptions of five recommender systems. A sixth article analyzes incentives for provision of recommendations. Figure 1 places the systems in a technical design space defined by five dimensions. First, the contents of an evaluation can be anything from a single bit (recommended or not) to unstructured textual annotations. Second, recommendations may be entered explicitly, but several systems gather implicit evaluations: GroupLens monitors users\u2019 reading times; PHOAKS mines Usenet articles for mentions of URLs; and Siteseer mines personal bookmark lists. Third, recommendations may be anonymous, tagged with the source\u2019s identity, or tagged with a pseudonym. The fourth dimension, and one of the richest areas for exploration, is how to aggregate evaluations. GroupLens, PHOAKS, and Siteseer employ variants on weighted voting. Fab takes that one step further to combine evaluations with content analysis. ReferralWeb combines suggested links between people to form longer referral chains. Finally, the (perhaps aggregated) evaluations may be used in several ways: negative recommendations may be filtered out, the items may be sorted according to numeric evaluations, or evaluations may accompany items in a display. Figures 2 and 3 identify dimensions of the domain space: The kinds of items being recommended and the people among whom evaluations are shared. Consider, first, the domain of items. The sheer volume is an important variable: Detailed textual reviews of restaurants or movies may be practical, but applying the same approach to thousands of daily Netnews messages would not. Ephemeral media such as netnews (most news servers throw away articles after one or two weeks) place a premium on gathering and distributing evaluations quickly, while evaluations for 19th century books can be gathered at a more leisurely pace. The last dimension describes the cost structure of choices people make about the items. Is it very costly to miss IT IS OFTEN NECESSARY TO MAKE CHOICES WITHOUT SUFFICIENT personal experience of the alternatives. In everyday life, we rely on"

Siteseer then delivers personalized recommendations of online content, Web pages, organized according to each user\u2019s folders. Bookmarks (including Hotlists and Favorites) are a desirable mechanism for gathering preference information as they are already maintained by the user, and thus require no additional behavior for the purpose of informing the recommendation system. In contrast to a click, which can be inadvertently done and rarely takes much effort or investment, bookmarks are the result of a very intentional act, something which (especially if the bookmark is placed in a folder) takes some degree of thought and effort, making them a less \u201cnoisy\u201d input for inference. Bookmarks also have specific limitations.

The rating servers predict scores based on the heuristic that people who agreed in the past will probably agree again. Users can protect their privacy by entering ratings under pseudonyms, without reducing the effectiveness of the score prediction.

In our experiments, we assume each model structure (every possible number of classes) is equally likely, and use a uniform prior for model parameters. We initialize the EM algorithm using the marginal-plus-noise technique described in [Thiesson et al., 1997]. 2.3.2 Bayesian Network Model An alternative model formulation for probabilistic collaborative ltering is a Bayesian network with a node corresponding to each item in the domain. The states of each node correspond to the possible vote values for each item. We also include a state corresponding to \\no vote\" for those domains where there is no natural interpretation for missing data. We then apply an algorithm for learning Bayesian networks to the training data, where missing votes in the training data are indicated by the \\no vote\" value. The learning algorithm searches over various model structures in terms of dependencies for each item. In the resulting network, each item will have a set of parent items that are the best predictors of its votes. Each conditional probability table is represented by a decision tree encoding the conditional probabilities for that node. An example of such a tree, for television viewing data (see Section 3.2) is shown in Figure 1. Details of the learning algorithm are discussed in Chickering et al.(1997). In the remainder of the paper the term Bayesian network will refer to these networks with a decision tree for each title."

Explicit voting refers to a user consciously expressing his or her preference for a title, usually on a discrete numerical scale. For example, GroupLens system of Resnick et al. [1994] uses a scale of one (bad) to ve (good) for users to rate Netnews articles, and users explicitly rate each article after reading it."

Lower scores are better. For absolute deviation, we examined the EachMovie dataset and results are shown in Table 5. This dataset has a vote range of 0 to 5, making vote prediction a relevant task. We examine the same algorithms as in the previous table, except now we use a correlation algorithm without applying any of the extensions except for inverse user frequency. The other extensions are not e ective for absolute deviation scoring. This basic correlation algorithm performs best in all but the Given 2 experiments, indicating that this algorithm performs well when given adequate data regarding the active case. The Bayesian clustered model does slightly better than the Bayesian network, and outperforms correlation in the Given 2 and Given 5 cases. 4.2 Inverse User Frequency In Section 2.2.2 we describe using inverse user frequency to modify vote values in applying memorybased algorithms. We performed a set of 12 experiments (3 datasets, 4 protocols) each for vector similarity and correlation judging the e ect of applying inverse user frequency under ranked scoring. In all experiments, application of IUF improved the ranked score, and in 23 of 24 cases results were statistically signi cant. The average improvement was 1.9%, with an improvement of 2.2% for the vector similarity algorithm, and 1.5% for the correlation algorithm. In 8 experiments run on the EachMovie dataset using absolute deviation scoring, the improvement averaged a more impressive 11%. Results were signi cant in 6 of the 8 experiments. The average improvement was of 15.5% for vector similarity, and 6.5% for correlation. 4.3 Case Ampli cation Case ampli cation (Section 2.2.3) modi es weights used in an memory-based algorithm to emphasize higher weights. We performed a set of 12 experiments (3 datasets, 4 protocols) applying case ampli cation to correlation. The average improvement in the ranked score was 4.8%, and results were signi cant in 11 of 12 experiments. There is no signi cant e ect of case ampli cation on absolute deviation scoring. We also ran experiments combining case ampli cation and inverse user frequency, and found the bene ts to be additive. 4.4 Probabilistic Methods We used a training set to build probabilistic models for each dataset. Each title was encoded with an additional explicit vote value of \\no vote\" to complete the dataset for probabilistic learning. When scoring with Bayesian networks and cluster models, the \\no vote\" values were explicitly entered into the network when missing, for both ranked and absolute deviation scoring. For the trees, the \\no vote\" values were entered in each tree independently in order to generate a probability for that title. For absolute deviation scoring, the expected vote was calculated by renormalizing the output probabilities, clamping the \\no vote\" probability to zero. There are roughly 1600 movies in the EachMovie dataset, too many to estimate a full model in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore the Bayesian methods were trained from EachMovie for the top 300 movies in terms of overall popularity. For testing, all 1600 movies were used. In the other datasets, all items were used for training and testing. For the Bayesian networks, we applied alternate prior speci cations which resulted in trees of varying complexity. Priors that strongly penalized splits generated Bayesian networks with nodes with approximately 2 to 4 parents and 4 to 6 distributions in the decision tree representation. The model with the larger trees had somewhere between 4 and 6 predecessors and 6 to 8 distributions per variable. In all our experiments the larger trees outperformed the smaller tree so we restrict our results to those models. Additional details are available in Breese et al. (1998). Applying clustering to the datasets identi ed 3 classes for the Neilsen dataset, 7 classes for the MS Web dataset, and 9 classes for the EachMovie dataset."

The majority of this work has concentrated on using decision-tree representations for the CPDs. In addition, researchers typically apply non-Bayesian (or asymptotically Bayesian) scoring functions such as MDL to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of networks to the data. \n \nIn this paper we investigate a Bayesian approach to learning Bayesian networks that contain the more general decision-graph representations of the CPDs. First, we describe how to evaluate the posterior probability-- that is, the Bayesian score--of such a network, given a database of observed cases. Second, we describe various search spaces that can be used, in conjunction with a scoring function and a search procedure, to identify one or more high-scoring networks. Finally, we present an experimentd evaluation of the search spaces, using a greedy algorithm and a Bayesian scoring function."
