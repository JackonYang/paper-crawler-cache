These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model."

Many of the state-of-the-art Recommender Systems algorithms rely on obtaining user ratings in order to later predict unknown ratings. An underlying assumption in this approach is that the user ratings can be treated as ground truth of the user's taste. However, users are inconsistent in giving their feedback, thus introducing an unknown amount of noise that challenges the validity of this assumption. \n \nIn this paper, we tackle the problem of analyzing and characterizing the noise in user feedback through ratings of movies. We present a user study aimed at quantifying the noise in user ratings that is due to inconsistencies. We measure RMSE values that range from 0.557 to 0.8156. We also analyze how factors such as item sorting and time of rating affect this noise."

However, users have been shown to be inconsistent and to introduce a non-negligible amount of natural noise in their ratings that affects the accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve RS accuracy by reducing the natural noise in the input data via a preprocessing step. In order to quantitatively understand the impact of natural noise, we first analyze the response of common recommendation algorithms to this noise. Next, we propose a novel algorithm to denoise existing datasets by means of re-rating: i.e. by asking users to rate previously rated items again. This denoising step yields very significant accuracy improvements. However, re-rating all items in the original dataset is unpractical. Therefore, we study the accuracy gains obtained when re-rating only some of the ratings.In particular, we propose two partial denoising strategies: data and user-dependent denoising. Finally, we compare the value of adding a rating of an unseen item vs. re-rating an item. We conclude with a proposal for RS to improve the quality of their user data and hence their accuracy: asking users to re-rate items might, in some circumstances, be more beneficial than asking users to rate unseen items."

Relevance feedback is typically used for query expansion during short-term modeling of a user's immediate information need and for user profiling during long-term modeling of a user's persistent interests and preferences. Traditional relevance feedback methods require that users explicitly give feedback by, for example, specifying keywords, selecting and marking documents, or answering questions about their interests . Such relevance feedback methods force users to engage in additional activities beyond their normal searching behavior . Since the cost to the user is high and the benefits are not always apparent, it can be difficult to collect the necessary data and the effectiveness of explicit techniques can be limited."

                "text": "Music consumption is biased towards a few popular artists. For instance, in 2007 only 1% of all digital tracks accounted for 80% of all sales. Similarly, 1,000 albums accounted for 50% of all album sales, and 80% of all albums sold were purchased less than 100 times. There is a need to assist people to filter, discover, personalise and recommend from the huge amount of music content available along the Long Tail. Current music recommendation algorithms try to accurately predict what people demand to listen to. However, quite often these algorithms tend to recommend popular \u2014or well\u2013known to the user\u2014 music, decreasing the effectiveness of the recommendations. These approaches focus on improving the accuracy of the recommendations. That is, try to make accurate predictions about what a user could listen to, or buy next, independently of how useful to the user could be the provided recommendations. In this Thesis we stress the importance of the user\u2019s perceived quality of the recommendations. We model the Long Tail curve of artist popularity to predict \u2014potentially\u2014 interesting and unknown music, hidden in the tail of the popularity curve. Effective recommendation systems should promote novel and relevant material (non\u2013obvious recommendations), taken primarily from the tail of a popularity distribution. The main contributions of this Thesis are: (i) a novel network\u2013based approach for recommender systems, based on the analysis of the item (or user) similarity graph, and the popularity of the items, (ii) a user\u2013centric evaluation that measures the user\u2019s relevance and novelty of the recommendations, and (iii) two prototype systems that implement the ideas derived from the theoretical work. Our findings have significant implications for recommender systems that assist users to explore the Long Tail, digging for content they might like."

We explore the variation in what different people consider relevant to the same query by mining three data sources: (1) explicit relevance judgments, (2) clicks on search results (a behavior-based implicit measure of relevance), and (3) the similarity of desktop content to search results (a content-based implicit measure of relevance). We find that people's explicit judgments for the same queries differ greatly. As a result, there is a large gap between how well search engines could perform if they were to tailor results to the individual, and how well they currently perform by returning results designed to satisfy everyone. We call this gap the potential for personalization. The two implicit indicators we studied provide complementary value for approximating this variation in result relevance among people. We discuss several uses of our findings, including a personalized search system that takes advantage of the implicit measures by ranking personally relevant results more highly and improving click-through rates."

Therefore, we attempt to side-step the problem of getting users to explicitly mark documents relevant by making predictions on relevance through analysing the user's interaction with the system. Specifically, we hypothesised that implicit and explicit feedback were interchangeable as sources of relevance information for relevance feedback. Through developing a system that utilised each type of feedback we were able to compare the two approaches in terms of search effectiveness."

However, most businesses today have item ontologies that provide a useful source of content descriptors that can be used to enhance the quality of recommendations generated. In this article, we present a novel approach to integrating user rating vectors with an item ontology to generate recommendations. The approach is novel in measuring similarity between users in that it first derives factors, referred to as impacts, driving the observed user behavior and then uses these factors within the similarity computation. In doing so, a more comprehensive user model is learned that is sensitive to the context of the user visit.\n An evaluation of our recommendation algorithm was carried out using data from an online retailer of movies with over 94,000 movies, 44,000 actors, and 10,000 directors within the item knowledge base. The evaluation showed a statistically significant improvement in the prediction accuracy over traditional collaborative filtering. Additionally, the algorithm was shown to generate recommendations for visitors that belong to sparse sections of the user space, areas where traditional collaborative filtering would generally fail to generate accurate recommendations."
