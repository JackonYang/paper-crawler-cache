More than that, it is a model contribution to descriptive linguistic method and data. It is written clearly and to the point, in a manner that is aesthetically elegant as well as scientifically satisfactory. It is sufficiently detailed, more so than is usual among American Indian grammars, to enable the reader to become familiar with the language and to construct correctly his own statements about the language.2 Phonology and morphology are treated fully; syntax is only briefly touched upon, as is customary in grammars of American Indian languages. The meanings of classes of morphemes and the translation of utterances are more careful and sensitive than is usually the case; cf. at random the meaning of the aorist suffix in \u00a7 18:2, or of the non-directive gerundial -taw in \u00a7 19:9. Although it is perhaps not the custom for linguists to study carefully the grammars of languages not related to their work, this is one of the few grammars which students and workers in linguistics should read with close attention to the method of handling descriptive and comparative data."

Linguists describe language instead, using a discontinuous or discrete mathematics called \u201clinguistics.\u201d The nature of this odd calculus is outlined and justified here. It treats speech communication as having a telegraphic structure. (Non\u2010linguists normally fail to orient themselves in this field because they treat speech as analogous to telephony.) The telegraph\u2010code structure of language is examined from top to bottom, and at each of its several levels of complexity (compared to the two levels of Morse code) its structure is shown to be defined by possibilities and impossibilities of combination among the units of that level. Above the highest level we find, instead of such absolute restrictions, conditional probabilities of occurrence: this is the semantic field, outside linguistics, where sociologists can work. Below the lowest level we find, instead of such absolute restrictions, conditional probabilities of phonetic quality: this is the phonetic field, outside linguistics, where physicists can work. Thus linguistics is peculiar among mathematical systems in that it abuts upon reality in two places instead of one. This statement is equivalent to defining a language as a symbolic system; that is, as a code."

                "text": "Language is the primary fact which concerns contemporary philosophy. Men have been speaking and writing for a long time, but it is only recently that the task of philosophy has been said to be the analysis of language. Ethical perplexities, social anxieties, the nature of scientific knowledge, religious speculations, are held not to be directly the problems of the philosopher. They enter his study by way of a domain of languages and sub-languages. This preoccupation with language is itself an unusual phenomenon in our intellectual history. It challenges the sociologist of philosophic ideas for an explanation, and it leads one to wonder upon what evidence philosophers have accepted the doctrine of linguistic primacy. Bertrand Russell has for many years been the leading proponent of the importance of the analysis of language. More than a half-century ago, he wrote: \"That all sound philosophy should begin with an analysis of propositions, is a truth too evident, perhaps to demand a proof.\" (19, p. 8). None the less, Russell sought to defend this \"truth\" with a sociological argument concerning the causes of philosophic beliefs. A large part of Western philosophy, Russell affirmed, was determined by the notion that every proposition must consist of a subject and a predicate. \"Any philosophy,\" he said, \"which uses either substance or the Absolute will be found, on inspection, to depend on this belief. Kant's belief in an unknowable thing-in-itself was largely due to the same theory.\" (19, p. 15). In his later writings, Russell often recurred to the sociological argument for the linguistic determination of philosophic ideas. \"We have to guard,\" he wrote, \"against assuming that grammar is the key to metaphysics,\" an assumption which he believed had been made by traditional philosophy. He referred with approval to the views of the philologist Sayce. \"Sayce maintained that all European philosophy since Aristotle has been dominated by the fact that philosophers spoke Indo-European languages, and therefore supposed the world, like the sentences they were used to, necessarily divisible into subjects and predicates.\" (18, p. 212). The linguistic interpretation of philosophic history was central in Russell's thinking, but it was never supported with the requisite historical data. It took on the character of a postulate whose proof was commended to others. He thus declared that \"a great book might be written showing the influence of syntax on philosophy; in such a work, the author could trace in detail the influence of the subject-predicate structure of sentences upon European thought, more particularly in the matter of 'substance.' \" (21, p. 243)."
