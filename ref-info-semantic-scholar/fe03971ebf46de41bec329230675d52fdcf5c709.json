The rating prediction task aims at predicting to what extent a user would like any given item, which would enable to recommend the items with the highest predicted scores. The ranking task on the other hand directly aims at recommending the most valuable items for the user. Several previous approaches proposed learning user and item representations to optimize both tasks simultaneously in a multi-task framework. In this work we propose a novel multi-task framework that exploits the fact that a user does a two-phase decision process - first decides to interact with an item (ranking task) and only afterward to rate it (rating prediction task). We evaluated our framework on two benchmark datasets, on two different configurations and showed its superiority over state-of-the-art methods."

The interaction information (i.e., feedback) between users and items are widely exploited to build recommendation models. The feedback data in recommender systems usually comes in the form of both explicit feedback (e.g., rating) and implicit feedback (e.g., browsing histories, click logs). Although existing works have begun to utilize either explicit or implicit feedback for better recommendation, they did not make best use of these feedback information together. In this paper, we first study the personalized ranking recommendation problem by integrating multiple feedbacks, i.e., one type of explicit feedback and multiple types of implicit feedbacks. Then we propose a unified and flexible personalized ranking framework MFPR to integrate multiple feedbacks. Moreover, as there are no readily available training data, an explicit feedback based training data generation algorithm is designed to generate item pairs with more accurate partial order consistent with the multiple feedbacks for the proposed ranking model. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the MFPR model, and the integration of multiple feedbacks making up better complementary information significantly improves recommendation performance."

In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive k-nearest-neighbor (kNN). Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN. Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion."

Explicit feedbacks are more precise but more difficult to collect from users while implicit feedbacks are much easier to collect though less accurate in reflecting user preferences. In the existing literature, separate models have been developed for either of these two forms of user feedbacks due to their heterogeneous representation. However in most real world recommended systems both explicit and implicit user feedback are abundant and could potentially complement each other. It is desirable to be able to unify these two heterogeneous forms of user feedback in order to generate more accurate recommendations. In this work, we developed matrix factorization models that can be trained from explicit and implicit feedback simultaneously. Experimental results of multiple datasets showed that our algorithm could effectively combine these two forms of heterogeneous user feedback to improve recommendation quality."

In this paper, we examine both approaches in detail, and find that the dominating difference lies instead in the training and test data considered: rating prediction is concerned with only the observed ratings, while ranking typically accounts for all items in the collection, whether the user has rated them or not. Furthermore, we show that predicting observed ratings, while popular in the literature, only solves a (small) part of the rating prediction task for any item in the collection, which is a common real-world problem. The reasons are selection bias in the data, combined with data sparsity. We show that the latter rating-prediction task involves the prediction task 'Who rated What' as a sub-problem, which can be cast as a classification or ranking problem. This suggests that solving the ranking problem is not only valuable by itself, but also for predicting the rating value of any item."

Given the current scenario, and under a situation where just implicit user feedback is available, it would be more appropriate either to provide recommendations using the implicit data and implicit-fedback-based methods, or to map implicit user feedback to explicit feedback and then use an explicit-based algorithm? On this paper, we analyze this problem in the context of music recommendation by means of a well-known implicit feedback recommendation method described in Hu et al. [1] by comparing the use of raw playcounts with the use of explicit data - user ratings - obtained by mapping implicit to explicit feedback with a novel mixedeects logistic regression model."

These systems often rely on Collaborating Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-K recommendation task."

These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model."

We propose Multi-feedback Bayesian Personalized Ranking (MF-BPR), a pairwise method that exploits different types of feedback with an extended sampling method. The feedback types are drawn from different \"channels\", in which users interact with items (e.g., clicks, likes, listens, follows, and purchases). We build on the insight that different kinds of feedback, e.g., a click versus a like, reflect different levels of commitment or preference. Our approach differs from previous work in that it exploits multiple sources of feedback simultaneously during the training process. The novelty of MF-BPR is an extended sampling method that equates feedback sources with \"levels\" that reflect the expected contribution of the signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments carried out on three datasets containing multiple types of feedback. Our experimental results demonstrate that with a right sampling method, MF-BPR outperforms BPR in terms of accuracy. We find that the advantage of MF-BPR lies in its ability to leverage level information when sampling negative items."

This is especially true for CF domains where the ratings are expressed numerically. We observe that, while we may lack the information in numerical ratings, we may have more data in the form of binary ratings. This is especially true when users can easily express themselves with their likes and dislikes for certain items. In this paper, we explore how to use the binary preference data expressed in the form of like/dislike to help reduce the impact of data sparsity of more expressive numerical ratings. We do this by transferring the rating knowledge from some auxiliary data source in binary form (that is, likes or dislikes), to a target numerical rating matrix. Our solution is to model both numerical ratings and like/dislike in a principled way, using a novel framework of Transfer by Collective Factorization (TCF). In particular, we construct the shared latent space collectively and learn the data-dependent effect separately. A major advantage of the TCF approach over previous collective matrix factorization (or bifactorization) methods is that we are able to capture the data-dependent effect when sharing the data-independent knowledge, so as to increase the over-all quality of knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TCF at various sparsity levels as compared to several state-of-the-art methods."

                "text": "Recommending a ranked list of interesting venues to users based on their preferences has become a key functionality in Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) such as Yelp and Gowalla. Bayesian Personalised Ranking (BPR) is a popular pairwise recommendation technique that is used to generate the ranked list of venues of interest to a user, by leveraging the user's implicit feedback such as their check-ins as instances of positive feedback, while randomly sampling other venues as negative instances. To alleviate the sparsity that affects the usefulness of recommendations by BPR for users with few check-ins, various approaches have been proposed in the literature to incorporate additional sources of information such as the social links between users, the textual content of comments, as well as the geographical location of the venues. However, such approaches can only readily leverage one source of additional information for negative sampling. Instead, we propose a novel Personalised Ranking Framework with Multiple sampling Criteria (PRFMC) that leverages both geographical influence and social correlation to enhance the effectiveness of BPR. In particular, we apply a multi-centre Gaussian model and a power-law distribution method, to capture geographical influence and social correlation when sampling negative venues, respectively. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three large-scale datasets from the Yelp, Gowalla and Brightkite LBSNs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of fusing both geographical influence and social correlation in our proposed PRFMC framework and its superiority in comparison to BPR-based and other similar ranking approaches. Indeed, our PRFMC approach attains a 37% improvement in MRR over a recently proposed approach that identifies negative venues only from social links."

However many real-world systems involve a spectrum of both implicit and explicit signals, ranging from clicks and purchases, to ratings and reviews. A natural question is whether implicit signals (which are dense but noisy) might help to predict explicit signals (which are sparse but reliable), or vice versa. Thus in this paper, we propose an item recommendation framework which jointly models this full spectrum of interactions. Our main observation is that in many settings, feedback signals exhibit monotonic dependency structures, i.e., any signal necessarily implies the presence of a weaker (or more implicit) signal (a 'review' action implies a 'purchase' action, which implies a 'click' action, etc.). We refer to these structures as 'monotonic behavior chains,' for which we develop new algorithms that exploit these dependencies. Using several new and existing datasets that exhibit a variety of feedback types, we demonstrate the quantitative performance of our approaches. We also perform qualitative analysis to uncover the relationships between different stages of implicit vs. explicit signals."

However, the heterogeneous nature of this information makes it difficult for recommender systems to leverage in a unified framework to boost the performance. Recently, the rapid development of representation learning techniques provides an approach to this problem. By translating the various information sources into a unified representation space, it becomes possible to integrate heterogeneous information for informed recommendation. In this work, we propose a Joint Representation Learning (JRL) framework for top-N recommendation. In this framework, each type of information source (review text, product image, numerical rating, etc) is adopted to learn the corresponding user and item representations based on available (deep) representation learning architectures. Representations from different sources are integrated with an extra layer to obtain the joint representations for users and items. In the end, both the per-source and the joint representations are trained as a whole using pair-wise learning to rank for top-N recommendation. We analyze how information propagates among different information sources in a gradient-descent learning paradigm, based on which we further propose an extendable version of the JRL framework (eJRL), which is rigorously extendable to new information sources to avoid model re-training in practice. By representing users and items into embeddings offline, and using a simple vector multiplication for ranking score calculation online, our framework also has the advantage of fast online prediction compared with other deep learning approaches to recommendation that learn a complex prediction network for online calculation."

Nearly all research on collaborative filtering and recommender systems is founded on the assumption that missing ratings are missing at random. The statistical theory of missing data shows that incorrect assumptions about missing data can lead to biased parameter estimation and prediction. In a recent study, we demonstrated strong evidence for violations of the missing at random condition in a real recommender system. In this paper we present the first study of the effect of non-random missing data on collaborative ranking, and extend our previous results regarding the impact of non-random missing data on collaborative prediction."

On the other hand, recommendation accuracy tends to decrease towards the long tail. In this paper, we quantitatively examine this trade-off between item popularity and recommendation accuracy. To this end, we assume that there is a selection bias towards popular items in the available data. This allows us to define a new accuracy measure that can be gradually tuned towards the long tail. We show that, under this assumption, this measure has the desirable property of providing nearly unbiased estimates concerning recommendation accuracy. In turn, this also motivates a refinement for training collaborative-filtering approaches. In various experiments with real-world data, including a user study, empirical evidence suggests that only a small, if any, bias of the recommendations towards less popular items is appreciated by users."

IR metrics have been found however to be strongly biased towards rewarding algorithms that recommend popular items \"the same bias that state of the art recommendation algorithms display. Recent research has confirmed and measured such biases, and proposed methods to avoid them. The fundamental question remains open though whether popularity is really a bias we should avoid or not; whether it could be a useful and reliable signal in recommendation, or it may be unfairly rewarded by the experimental biases. We address this question at a formal level by identifying and modeling the conditions that can determine the answer, in terms of dependencies between key random variables, involving item rating, discovery and relevance. We find conditions that guarantee popularity to be effective or quite the opposite, and for the measured metric values to reflect a true effectiveness, or qualitatively deviate from it. We exemplify and confirm the theoretical findings with empirical results. We build a crowdsourced dataset devoid of the usual biases displayed by common publicly available data, in which we illustrate contradictions between the accuracy that would be measured in a common biased offline experimental setting, and the actual accuracy that can be measured with unbiased observations."

Seeking to evaluate recommendation rankings\u2014which largely determine the effective accuracy in matching user needs\u2014rather than predicted rating values, Information Retrieval metrics have started to be applied for the evaluation of recommender systems. In this paper we analyse the main issues and potential divergences in the application of Information Retrieval methodologies to recommender system evaluation, and provide a systematic characterisation of experimental design alternatives for this adaptation. We lay out an experimental configuration framework upon which we identify and analyse specific statistical biases arising in the adaptation of Information Retrieval metrics to recommendation tasks, namely sparsity and popularity biases. These biases considerably distort the empirical measurements, hindering the interpretation and comparison of results across experiments. We develop a formal characterisation and analysis of the biases upon which we analyse their causes and main factors, as well as their impact on evaluation metrics under different experimental configurations, illustrating the theoretical findings with empirical evidence. We propose two experimental design approaches that effectively neutralise such biases to a large extent. We report experiments validating our proposed experimental variants, and comparing them to alternative approaches and metrics that have been defined in the literature with similar or related purposes."

                "text": "Venue recommendation is an important application for Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), such as Yelp, and has been extensively studied in recent years. Matrix Factorisation (MF) is a popular Collaborative Filtering (CF) technique that can suggest relevant venues to users based on an assumption that similar users are likely to visit similar venues. In recent years, deep neural networks have been successfully applied to tasks such as speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. Building upon this momentum, various approaches for recommendation have been proposed in the literature to enhance the effectiveness of MF-based approaches by exploiting neural network models such as: word embeddings to incorporate auxiliary information (e.g. textual content of comments); and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to capture sequential properties of observed user-venue interactions. However, such approaches rely on the traditional inner product of the latent factors of users and venues to capture the concept of collaborative filtering, which may not be sufficient to capture the complex structure of user-venue interactions. In this paper, we propose a Deep Recurrent Collaborative Filtering framework (DRCF) with a pairwise ranking function that aims to capture user-venue interactions in a CF manner from sequences of observed feedback by leveraging Multi-Layer Perception and Recurrent Neural Network architectures. Our proposed framework consists of two components: namely Generalised Recurrent Matrix Factorisation (GRMF) and Multi-Level Recurrent Perceptron (MLRP) models. In particular, GRMF and MLRP learn to model complex structures of user-venue interactions using element-wise and dot products as well as the concatenation of latent factors. In addition, we propose a novel sequence-based negative sampling approach that accounts for the sequential properties of observed feedback and geographical location of venues to enhance the quality of venue suggestions, as well as alleviate the cold-start users problem. Experiments on three large checkin and rating datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed framework by outperforming various state-of-the-art approaches."

As to test recommender systems, we present two performance measures that can be estimated, under mild assumptions, without bias from data even when ratings are missing not at random (MNAR). As to achieve optimal test results, we present appropriate surrogate objective functions for efficient training on MNAR data. Their main property is to account for all ratings - whether observed or missing in the data. Concerning the top-k hit rate on test data, our experiments indicate dramatic improvements over even sophisticated methods that are optimized on observed ratings only."

                "text": "The success of \"infinite-inventory\" retailers such as Amazon.com and Netflix has been largely attributed to a \"long tail\" phenomenon. Although the majority of their inventory is not in high demand, these niche products, unavailable at limited-inventory competitors, generate a significant fraction of total revenue in aggregate. In addition, tail product availability can boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of \"one-stop shopping\" for both their mainstream and niche tastes. However, most of existing recommender systems, especially collaborative filter based methods, can not recommend tail products due to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that to recommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long tail products adds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. \n \nIn this paper, we propose a novel suite of graph-based algorithms for the long tail recommendation. We first represent user-item information with undirected edge-weighted graph and investigate the theoretical foundation of applying Hitting Time algorithm for long tail item recommendation. To improve recommendation diversity and accuracy, we extend Hitting Time and propose efficient Absorbing Time algorithm to help users find their favorite long tail items. Finally, we refine the Absorbing Time algorithm and propose two entropy-biased Absorbing Cost algorithms to distinguish the variation on different user-item rating pairs, which further enhances the effectiveness of long tail recommendation. Empirical experiments on two real life datasets show that our proposed algorithms are effective to recommend long tail items and outperform state-of-the-art recommendation techniques."

'Bundling' may be a means of increasing sales revenue, but may also be a means for content creators to expose users to new items that they may not have considered in isolation. In this paper, we seek to understand the semantics of what constitutes a 'good' bundle, in order to recommend existing bundles to users on the basis of their constituent products, as well the more difficult task of generating new bundles that are personalized to a user. To do so we collect a new dataset from the Steam video game distribution platform, which is unique in that it contains both 'traditional' recommendation data (rating and purchase histories between users and items), as well as bundle purchase information. We assess issues such as bundle size and item compatibility, and show that these features, when combined with traditional matrix factorization techniques, can lead to highly effective bundle recommendation and generation."
