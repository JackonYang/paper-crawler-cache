These systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative ltering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative ltering systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative ltering techniques. Item-based techniques rst analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between di erent items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users. In this paper we analyze di erent item-based recommendation generation algorithms. We look into di erent techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vectors) and di erent techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). Finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. Our experiments suggest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time providing better quality than the best available userbased algorithms."

In this article we present an explanation of how recommender systems are related to some traditional database analysis techniques. We examine how recommender systems help E-commerce sites increase sales and analyze the recommender systems at six market-leading sites. Based on these examples, we create a taxonomy of recommender systems, including the inputs required from the consumers, the additional knowledge required from the database, the ways the recommendations are presented to consumers, the technologies used to create the recommendations, and the level of personalization of the recommendations. We identify five commonly used E-commerce recommender application models, describe several open research problems in the field of recommender systems, and examine privacy implications of recommender systems technology."

In content-based recommendation one tries to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past, whereas in collaborative recommendation one identifies users whose tastes are similar to those of the given user and recommends items they have liked. Our approach in Fab has been to combine these two methods. Here, we explain how a hybrid system can incorporate the advantages of both methods while inheriting the disadvantages of neither. In addition to what one might call the \u201cgeneric advantages\u201d inherent in any hybrid system, the particular design of the Fab architecture brings two additional benefits. First, two scaling problems common to all Web services are addressed\u2014an increasing number of users and an increasing number of documents. Second, the system automatically identifies emergent communities of interest in the user population, enabling enhanced group awareness and communications. Here we describe the two approaches for contentbased and collaborative recommendation, explain how a hybrid system can be created, and then describe Fab, an implementation of such a system. For more details on both the implemented architecture and the experimental design the reader is referred to [1]. The content-based approach to recommendation has its roots in the information retrieval (IR) community, and employs many of the same techniques. Text documents are recommended based on a comparison between their content and a user profile. Data"

Recommending items based on similarity of interest (a.k.a. collaborative filtering) is attractive for many domains: books, CDs, movies, etc., but does not always work well. Because data are always sparse - any given person has seen only a small fraction of all movies - much more accurate predictions can be made by grouping people into clusters with similar movies and grouping movies into clusters which tend to be liked by the same people. Finding optimal clusters is tricky because the movie groups should be used to help determine the people groups and visa versa. We present a formal statistical model of collaborative filtering, and compare different algorithms for estimating the model parameters including variations of K-means clustering and Gibbs Sampling. This formal model is easily extended to handle clustering of objects with multiple attributes."

In content-based recommendation one tries to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past, whereas in collaborative recommendation one identifies users whose tastes are similar to those of the given user and recommends items they have liked. Our approach in Fab has been to combine these two methods. Here, we explain how a hybrid system can incorporate the advantages of both methods while inheriting the disadvantages of neither. In addition to what one might call the \u201cgeneric advantages\u201d inherent in any hybrid system, the particular design of the Fab architecture brings two additional benefits. First, two scaling problems common to all Web services are addressed\u2014an increasing number of users and an increasing number of documents. Second, the system automatically identifies emergent communities of interest in the user population, enabling enhanced group awareness and communications. Here we describe the two approaches for contentbased and collaborative recommendation, explain how a hybrid system can be created, and then describe Fab, an implementation of such a system. For more details on both the implemented architecture and the experimental design the reader is referred to [1]. The content-based approach to recommendation has its roots in the information retrieval (IR) community, and employs many of the same techniques. Text documents are recommended based on a comparison between their content and a user profile. Data"

In this paper we describe several algorithms designed for this task, including techniques based on correlation coefficients, vector-based similarity calculations, and statistical Bayesian methods. We compare the predictive accuracy of the various methods in a set of representative problem domains. We use two basic classes of evaluation metrics. The first characterizes accuracy over a set of individual predictions in terms of average absolute deviation. The second estimates the utility of a ranked list of suggested items. This metric uses an estimate of the probability that a user will see a recommendation in an ordered list. \n \nExperiments were run for datasets associated with 3 application areas, 4 experimental protocols, and the 2 evaluation metr rics for the various algorithms. Results indicate that for a wide range of conditions, Bayesian networks with decision trees at each node and correlation methods outperform Bayesian-clustering and vector-similarity methods. Between correlation and Bayesian networks, the preferred method depends on the nature of the dataset, nature of the application (ranked versus one-by-one presentation), and the availability of votes with which to make predictions. Other considerations include the size of database, speed of predictions, and learning time."

PCA facilitates dimensionality reduction for offline clustering of users and rapid computation of recommendations. For a database of n users, standard nearest-neighbor techniques require O(n) processing time to compute recommendations, whereas Eigentaste requires O(1) (constant) time. We compare Eigentaste to alternative algorithms using data from Jester, an online joke recommending system.Jester has collected approximately 2,500,000 ratings from 57,000 users. We use the Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) measure to compare performance of different algorithms. In the Appendix we use Uniform and Normal distribution models to derive analytic estimates of NMAE when predictions are random. On the Jester dataset, Eigentaste computes recommendations two orders of magnitude faster with no loss of accuracy. Jester is online at: http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu"

We present a scalable clustering framework applicable to a wide class of iterative clustering. We require at most one scan of the database. In this work, the framework is instantiated and numerically justified with the popular K-Means clustering algorithm. The method is based on identifying regions of the data that are compressible, regions that must be maintained in memory, and regions that are discardable. The algorithm operates within the confines of a limited memory buffer. Empirical results demonstrate that the scalable scheme outperforms a sampling-based approach. In our scheme, data resolution is preserved to the extent possible based upon the size of the allocated memory buffer and the fit of current clustering model to the data. The framework is naturally extended to update multiple clustering models simultaneously. We empirically evaluate on synthetic and publicly available data sets."
