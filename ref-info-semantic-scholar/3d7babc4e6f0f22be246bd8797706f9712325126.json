For example, the performance of Evolutionary Algorithms critically depends on the judicious setting of the operator rates. The Adaptive Operator Selection (AOS) heuristic that is proposed here rewards each operator based on the extreme value of the fitness improvement lately incurred by this operator, and uses a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) selection process based on those rewards to choose which operator to apply next. This Extreme-based Multi-Armed Bandit approach is experimentally validated against the Average-based MAB method, and is shown to outperform previously published methods, whether using a classical Average-based rewarding technique or the same Extreme-based mechanism. The validation test suite includes the easy One-Max problem and a family of hard problems known as \"Long k-paths\"."

Such a procedure is made of two main components: a credit assignment mechanism, that computes a reward for each operator at hand based on some characteristics of the past offspring; and an adaptation rule, that modifies the selection mechanism based on the rewards of the different operators. This paper is concerned with the latter, and proposes a new approach for it based on the well-known Multi-Armed Bandit paradigm. However, because the basic Multi-Armed Bandit methods have been developed for static frameworks, a specific Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm is proposed, that hybridizes an optimal Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm with the statistical Page-Hinkley test, which enforces the efficient detection of changes in time series. This original Operator Selection procedure is then compared to the state-of-the-art rules known as Probability Matching and Adaptive Pursuit on several artificial scenarios, after a careful sensitivity analysis of all methods. The Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit method is found to outperform the other methods on a scenario from the literature, while on another scenario, the basic Multi-Armed Bandit performs best."

The control process is based on two main components, the credit assignment, that defines the reward that will be used to evaluate the quality of an operator after it has been applied, and the operator selection mechanism, that selects one operator based on some operators qualities. Two previously developed Adaptive Operator Selection methods are combined here: Compass evaluates the performance of operators by considering not only the fitness improvements from parent to offspring, but also the way they modify the diversity of the population, and their execution time; Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandit proposes a selection strategy based on the well-known UCB algorithm, achieving a compromise between exploitation and exploration, while nevertheless quickly adapting to changes. Tests with the proposed method, called ExCoDyMAB, are carried out using several hard instances of the Satisfiability problem (SAT). Results show the good synergetic effect of combining both approaches."

Instead of the average fitness improvement of newborn offspring, this paper proposes to use some empirical order statistics of those improvements, arguing that rare but highly beneficial jumps matter as much or more than frequent but small improvements. An extreme value based Credit Assignment is thus proposed, rewarding each operator with the best fitness improvement observed in a sliding window for this operator. This mechanism, combined with existing Adaptive Operator Selection rules, is investigated in an EC-like setting. First results show that the proposed method allows both the Adaptive Pursuitand the Dynamic Multi-Armed Banditselection rules to actually track the best operators along evolution."

In recent work, we adopted an online approach, in which a performance model is iteratively updated and used to guide selection on a sequence of problem instances. The resulting exploration-exploitation trade-off was represented as a bandit problem with expert advice, using an existing solver for this game, but this required the setting of an arbitrary bound on algorithm runtimes, thus invalidating the optimal regret of the solver. In this paper, we propose a simpler framework for representing algorithm selection as a bandit problem, with partial information, and an unknown bound on losses. We adapt an existing solver to this game, proving a bound on its expected regret, which holds also for the resulting algorithm selection technique. We present experiments with a set of SAT solvers on a mixed SAT-UNSAT benchmark."

In this paper we consider the latter option. The allocation strategies discussed in the literature basically belong to the class of probability matching algorithms. These strategies adapt the operator probabilities in such a way that they match the reward distribution. In this paper we introduce an alternative adaptive allocation strategy, called the adaptive pursuit method. We compare this method with the probability matching approach in a non-stationary environment. Calculations and experimental results show the superior performance of the adaptive pursuit algorithm. If the reward distributions stay stationary for some time, the adaptive pursuit method converges rapidly and accurately to an operator probability distribution that results in a much higher probability of selecting the current optimal operator and a much higher average reward than with the probability matching strategy. Yet most importantly, the adaptive pursuit scheme remains sensitive to changes in the reward distributions, and reacts swiftly to non-stationary shifts in the environment."

A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support."

Typically these are specified before the algorithm is run and include population size, selection rate, operator probabilities, not to mention the representation and the operators themselves. This book gives the reader a solid perspective on the different approaches that have been proposed to automate control of these parameters as well as understanding their interactions. The book covers a broad area of evolutionary computation, including genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, genetic programming, estimation of distribution algorithms, and also discusses the issues of specific parameters used in parallel implementations, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, and practical consideration for real-world applications. It is a recommended read for researchers and practitioners of evolutionary computation and heuristic methods."

Two extensions of the UCBT algorithm are combined in order to handle dynamic multi-armed bandits, and specifically to cope with fast variations in the rewards. Firstly, a change point detection test based on Page-Hinkley statistics is used to overcome the limitations due to the UCBT inertia. Secondly, a controlled forgetting strategy dubbed Meta-Bandit is proposed to take care of the Exploration vs Exploitation trade-off when the PH test is triggered. Extensive empirical validation shows significant improvements compared to the baseline algorithms. The paper also investigates the sensitivity of the proposed algorithm with respect to the number of available options."

Our controller, named Compass, provides an abstraction of GA's parameters that allows the user to directly adjust the balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) and genetic programming (GP) stress the role of crossover, while evolutionary programming (EP) and evolution strategies (ESs) stress the role of mutation. The existence of many different forms of crossover further complicates the issue. Despite theoretical analysis, it appears difficult to decide a priori which form of crossover to use, or even if crossover should be used at all. One possible solution to this difficulty is to have the EA be self-adaptive, i.e., to have the EA dynamically modify which forms of crossover to use and how often to use them, as it solves a problem. This paper describes an adaptive mechanism for controlling the use of crossover in an EA and explores the behavior of this mechanism in a number of different situations. An improvement to the adaptive mechanism is then presented. Surprisingly this improvement can also be used to enhance performance in a non-adaptive EA."

The effect upon genetic algorithm performance of two adaptation methods upon both well-studied theoretical problems and a hard problem from operations research, the flowshop sequencing problem, are therefore examined. The results obtained indicate that the applicability of operator adaptation is dependent upon three basic assumptions being satisfied by the problem being tackled."

The highly stochastic nature of an EA typically leads to a high variance of the measurements. The standard statistical method to reduce variance is measurement replication, i.e., averaging over several test runs with identical parameter settings. The computational cost of measurement replication scales with the variance and is often too high to allow for results of statistical significance. In this paper we study an alternative: the REVAC method for Relevance Estimation and Value Calibration, and we investigate how different levels of measurement replication influence the cost and quality of its calibration results. Two sets ofof experiments are reported: calibrating a genetic algorithm on standard benchmark problems, and calibrating a complex simulation in evolutionary agent-based economics. We find that measurement replication is not essential to REVAC, which emerges as a strong and efficient alternative to existing statistical methods."

More specifically, we address the following questions: given two different methods, how to get the most out of both of them? When should we use one and when should we use the other in order to get maximum efficiency? We present a model for hybridizing genetic algorithms (GAs) based on a concept that decision theorists call probability matching and we use it to combine an elitist selecto-recombinative GA with a simple hill climber (HC). Tests on an easy problem with a small population size match our intuition that both GA and HC are needed to solve the problem efficiently."

The result poses an interesting dilemma for many practitioners in the sense that, with such a wide variety of algorithms and approaches, it is often hard to se the relationships between them, assess strengths and weaknesses, and make good choices for new application areas. This tutorial is intended to give an overview of a general EC framework that can help compare and contrast approaches, encourages crossbreeding, and facilitates intelligent design choices. The use of this framework is then illustrated by showing how traditional EAs can be compared and contrasted with it, and how new EAs can be effectively designed using it.

Taking inspiration from methods proposed in the machine learning literature for model selection through cross-validation, we propose a procedure that empirically evaluates a set of candidate configurations by discarding bad ones as soon as statistically sufficient evidence is gathered against them. We empirically evaluate our procedure using as an example the configuration of an ant colony optimization algorithm applied to the traveling salesman problem. The experimental results show that our procedure is able to quickly reduce the number of candidates, and allows to focus on the most promising ones."

A framework is devised for distinguishing between measurements of performance and the interpretation of those measurements for purposes of adaptation. Several examples of measurements and statistical interpretations are provided. Probability value adaptation is tested using an EA with 10 search operators against 10 test problems with results indicating that both the type of measurement and its statistical interpretation play significant roles in EA performance. We also find that selecting operators based on the prevalence of outliers rather than on average performance is able to provide considerable improvements to adaptive methods and soundly outperforms the non-adaptive case."

It is of interest to everyone working on machine learning. Academics will be inspired by the ingenuity shown by industrial users of EC on very challenging problems, some of which could not previously be solved. Practitioners are shown real-world successes. These provide the confidence and insight needed to deploy EC on their problems. The book comprises 15 examples of cutting-edge research and applications that will attract machine learning specialists. Both undergraduate and graduate students will also find it both insightful and inspiring. It is an excellent book for machine learning researchers, since it brings together articles specially selected by very experienced editors, to demonstrate\u2014and in some cases showcase\u2014applications and ideas. These include articles by researchers who are widely published and provides a great path forward for other investigators. The articles cover research in four categories. (1) Real-world application success stories. (2) Real-world application lessons learned. (3) Academic case studies of real-world applications. (4) Technology transfer to solve real-world problems. The book clearly illustrates the application of Evolutionary Computation on large scale, complex applications as opposed to \u2018\u2018toy\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018test\u2019\u2019 problems. It will help spread the use of EC in industry. The articles openly discuss the issues and challenges involved in successfully using EC on real-world applications. They provide a wealth of experience packed into a single resource. The book demonstrates many analysis hurdles which were overcome using EC."

Unfortunately, the total number of experiments required may be very large, which often makes such research work computationally prohibitive. In this paper, the application of a statistical method called racing is proposed as a general-purpose tool to reduce the computational requirements of large-scale experimental studies in evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results are presented that show that racing typically requires only a small fraction of the cost of an exhaustive experimental study."

First, we provide a brief overview of EAs. Then the remaining text is divided into three parts. Section 2 discusses the use of EAs for KDD. The emphasis is on the use of EAs for discovering high-level prediction rules, but we also discuss the use of EAs in attribute selection and in the optimization of parameters for other kinds of KDD algorithms (such as decision trees and nearest neighbor algorithms). Section 3 discusses three research problems in the design of an EA for KDD, namely, how to discover comprehensible rules with genetic programming, how to discover surprising (interesting) rules, and how to scale up EAs with parallel processing. Finally, Section 4 discusses what the added value of KDD is for EAs. This section includes the remark that generalization performance on a separate test set (unseen during training, or EA run) is a basic principle for evaluating the quality of discovered knowledge, and then suggests that this principle should be followed in other EA applications."

I highly recommend it as a highly concentrated source of good problem-solving approaches that are applicable to many real-world problems."

They also added a chapter on problems, reflecting the overall book focus on problem-solvers, a chapter on parameter tuning, which they combined with the parameter control and \"how-to\" chapters into a methodological part, and finally a chapter on evolutionary robotics with an outlook on possible exciting developments in this field. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in artificial intelligence and computational intelligence, and for self-study by practitioners and researchers engaged with all aspects of bioinspired design and optimization."

However, though most of them share a common structure, no existing software package allows the user to actually shift from one model to another by simply changing a few parameters, e.g. in a single window of a Graphical User Interface. This paper presents GUIDE, a \\(\\underline{G}raphical~\\underline{U}ser~\\underline{I}nterface\\) for \\(\\underline{D}REAM~\\underline{E}xperiments\\) that, among other user-friendly features, unifies all kinds of EAs into a single panel, as far as evolution parameters are concerned. Such a window can be used either to ask for one of the well known ready-to-use algorithms, or to very easily explore new combinations that have not yet been studied. Another advantage of grouping all necessary elements to describe virtually all kinds of EAs is that it creates a fantastic pedagogic tool to teach EAs to students and newcomers to the field."

The asymptotic distribution of this estimate and associated test statistics are derived and numerical results given. The relation to likelihood inference is emphasized. Asymptotic results are compared with empirical sequential results, and some practical implications are discussed. The cumulative sum scheme for detecting distributional change in a sequence of random variables is a well-known technique in quality control, dating from the paper of Page (1954) to the recent expository account by van Dobben de Bruyn (1968). Throughout the literature on cumulative sum schemes the emphasis is placed on tests of departure from initial conditions. The purpose of this paper is to examine a secondary aspect: estimation of the index T in a sequence {xt}, where the departure from initial conditions has taken place. The work is closely related to an earlier paper by Hinkley (1970), in which maximum likelihood estimation and inference were discussed. We consider specifically sequences of normal random variables x1, ..., xT, say, where initially the mean 00 and the variance o2 are known. A cumulative sum, cusum, scheme is used to detect possible change in mean from 00, and for simplicity suppose that it is a one-sided scheme for detecting decrease in mean. Then the procedure is to compute the cumulative sums t"

                "text": "We believe that punctuational change dominates the history of life: evolution is concentrated in very rapid events of speciation (geologically instantaneous, even if tolerably continuous in ecological time). Most species, during their geological history, either do not change in any appreciable way, or else they fluctuate mildly in morphology, with no apparent direction. Phyletic gradualism is very rare and too slow, in any case, to produce the major events of evolution. Evolutionary trends are not the product of slow, directional transformation within lineages; they represent the differential success of certain species within a clade\u2014speciation may be random with respect to the direction of a trend (Wright's rule). As an a priori bias, phyletic gradualism has precluded any fair assessment of evolutionary tempos and modes. It could not be refuted by empirical catalogues constructed in its light because it excluded contrary information as the artificial result of an imperfect fossil record. With the model of punctuated equilibria, an unbiased distribution of evolutionary tempos can be established by treating stasis as data and by recording the pattern of change for all species in an assemblage. This distribution of tempos can lead to strong inferences about modes. If, as we predict, the punctuational tempo is prevalent, then speciation\u2014not phyletic evolution\u2014must be the dominant mode of evolution. We argue that virtually none of the examples brought forward to refute our model can stand as support for phyletic gradualism; many are so weak and ambiguous that they only reflect the persistent bias for gradualism still deeply embedded in paleontological thought. Of the few stronger cases, we concentrate on Gingerich's data for Hyopsodus and argue that it provides an excellent example of species selection under our model. We then review the data of several studies that have supported our model since we published it five years ago. The record of human evolution seems to provide a particularly good example: no gradualism has been detected within any hominid taxon, and many are long-ranging; the trend to larger brains arises from differential success of essentially static taxa. The data of molecular genetics support our assumption that large genetic changes often accompany the process of speciation. Phyletic gradualism was an a priori assertion from the start\u2014it was never \u201cseen\u201d in the rocks; it expressed the cultural and political biases of 19th century liberalism. Huxley advised Darwin to eschew it as an \u201cunnecessary difficulty.\u201d We think that it has now become an empirical fallacy. A punctuational view of change may have wide validity at all levels of evolutionary processes. At the very least, it deserves consideration as an alternate way of interpreting the history of life."

                "text": "Chapter 7 covers, in depth, density estimators, thresholding, the use of nonlinear density estimators, multivariate wavelets estimators, and multiscale estimators. Chapter 8 provides an overview of Bayesian inference, which makes use of the data and prior information to select a less ad hoc shrinkage procedure for density estimation. Chapter 9 attempts to give an overview of the use of wavelet transform and its properties as applied to stochastic time series. In fact most of the chapter deals with the use of wavelets in estimating spectral densities, and then it briefly mentions the properties of the wavelets spectrum. Of pititular interest are the whitening properties of wavelet transform because they are approximate eigenfunctions to stationary stochastic time series. This is an important property for applied practitioners. I wish the author had expanded on this section and showed the similarity of wavelet transform to principal components analysis. Examples illustrating the use of this property for online modeling and monitoring are also lacking. Chapters 10-l 1 describe the use of wavelets to generate random densities and have references to miscellaneous other statistical applications of wavelets such as turbulence. This is not a book for casual readers of Technometrics as an introductory textbook on wavelets. As the author points out, \u201cThis book is aimed at graduate students in statistics or mathematics, and practicing statisticians\u201d and \u201crequires proficiency in advanced calculus.\u201d For readers meeting these requirements, or those just familiar with wavelet theory, mathematically inclined, and wanting to learn more, the book will be enjoyable and interesting. It is well written and organized with compact derivations and extensive references and can serve as a very good reference on the exciting topic of wavelets."

Money management firms that work with UMA (unified management account) overlay managers give up part of their fees in return for reduced portfolio administration. Overlay managers claim that UMA accounts will open the market for fully integrated portfolios to smaller investors who previously lacked the required assets for SMA minimums. UMAs are making inroads with regional and mid-sized brokerage firms. Industry observers say that larger financial institutions are also developing internally managed UMAs. Some CFA charterholders who work as private client wealth managers are skeptical that UMAs will have significant impact on their operations."
