Typical recommendation algorithms were built on the following bases: (1) assuming users and items are IID, namely independent and identically distributed, and (2) focusing on specific aspects such as user preferences or contents. In reality, complex recommendation tasks involve and request (1) personalized outcomes to tailor heterogeneous subjective preferences; and (2) explicit and implicit objective coupling relationships between users, items, and ratings to be considered as intrinsic forces driving preferences. This inevitably involves the non-IID complexity and the need of combining subjective preference with objective couplings hidden in recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a novel generic coupled matrix factorization (CMF) model by incorporating non-IID coupling relations between users and items. Such couplings integrate the intra-coupled interactions within an attribute and inter-coupled interactions among different attributes. Experimental results on two open data sets demonstrate that the user/item couplings can be effectively applied in RS and CMF outperforms the benchmark methods."

With the computation only on the non-zero ratings, Poisson Factorization (PF) enabled by variational inference has shown its high efficiency in scalable recommendation, e.g., modeling millions of ratings. However, as PF learns the ratings by individual users on items with the Gamma distribution, it cannot capture the coupling relations between users (items) and the rating popularity (i.e., favorable rating scores that are given to one item) and rating sparsity (i.e., those users (items) with many zero ratings) for one item (user). This work proposes Coupled Poisson Factorization (CPF) to learn the couplings between users (items), and the user/item attributes (i.e., metadata) are integrated into CPF to form the Metadata-integrated CPF (mCPF) to not only handle sparse but also popular ratings in very large-scale data. Our empirical results show that the proposed models significantly outperform PF and address the key limitations in PF for scalable recommendation.\n \n"

                "text": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a successful approach commonly used by many recommender systems. Conventional CF-based methods use the ratings given to items by users as the sole source of information for learning to make recommendation. However, the ratings are often very sparse in many applications, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. To address this sparsity problem, auxiliary information such as item content information may be utilized. Collaborative topic regression (CTR) is an appealing recent method taking this approach which tightly couples the two components that learn from two different sources of information. Nevertheless, the latent representation learned by CTR may not be very effective when the auxiliary information is very sparse. To address this problem, we generalize recently advances in deep learning from i.i.d. input to non-i.i.d. (CF-based) input and propose in this paper a hierarchical Bayesian model called collaborative deep learning (CDL), which jointly performs deep representation learning for the content information and collaborative filtering for the ratings (feedback) matrix. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets from different domains show that CDL can significantly advance the state of the art."

The underlying assumption is that a user\u2019s taste is similar to his/her friends\u2019 in social networking. In fact, users enjoy different groups of items with different preferences. A user may be treated as trustful by his/her friends more on some specific rather than all groups. Unfortunately, most of the extant social recommender systems are not able to differentiate user\u2019s social influence in different groups, resulting in the unsatisfactory recommendation results. Moreover, most extant systems mainly rely on social relations, but overlook the influence of relations between items. In this paper, we propose an innovative coupled group-based matrix factorization model for recommender system by leveraging the user and item groups learned by topic modeling and incorporating couplings between users and items and within users and items. Experiments conducted on publicly available data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

To handle the sparsity problem, several recommendation techniques have been proposed that additionally consider auxiliary information to improve rating prediction accuracy. In particular, when rating data is sparse, document modeling-based approaches have improved the accuracy by additionally utilizing textual data such as reviews, abstracts, or synopses. However, due to the inherent limitation of the bag-of-words model, they have difficulties in effectively utilizing contextual information of the documents, which leads to shallow understanding of the documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model, convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF) that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Consequently, ConvMF captures contextual information of documents and further enhances the rating prediction accuracy. Our extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets show that ConvMF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models even when the rating data is extremely sparse. We also demonstrate that ConvMF successfully captures subtle contextual difference of a word in a document. Our implementation and datasets are available at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/ConvMF."

Most previous systems are based on the user-item recommendation matrix, which contains users' history recommendation activities on items. In this paper, we propose a novel predictive collaborative filtering approach that exploits both the partially observed user-item recommendation matrix and the item-based side information to produce top-N recommender systems. The proposed approach automatically identifies the most interesting items for each user from his or her non-recommended item pool by aggregating over his or her recommended items via a low-rank coefficient matrix. Moreover, it also simultaneously builds linear regression models from the item-based side information such as item reviews to predict the item recommendation scores for the users. The proposed approach is formulated as a rank constrained joint minimization problem with integrated least squares losses, for which an efficient analytical solution can be derived. To evaluate the proposed learning technique, empirical evaluations on five recommendation tasks are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach comparing to the competing methods."

Despite great progress, existing methods seem to have a strong bias towards low- or high-order interactions, or require expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we show that it is possible to derive an end-to-end learning model that emphasizes both low- and high-order feature interactions. The proposed model, DeepFM, combines the power of factorization machines for recommendation and deep learning for feature learning in a new neural network architecture. Compared to the latest Wide & Deep model from Google, DeepFM has a shared input to its \"wide\" and \"deep\" parts, with no need of feature engineering besides raw features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DeepFM over the existing models for CTR prediction, on both benchmark data and commercial data."

These systems often rely on Collaborating Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-K recommendation task."

Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide & Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow."

The resulting research progress has established the importance of the user-item (U-I) matrix, which encodes the individual preferences of users for items in a collection, for recommender systems. The U-I matrix provides the basis for collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, the dominant framework for recommender systems. Currently, new recommendation scenarios are emerging that offer promising new information that goes beyond the U-I matrix. This information can be divided into two categories related to its source: rich side information concerning users and items, and interaction information associated with the interplay of users and items. In this survey, we summarize and analyze recommendation scenarios involving information sources and the CF algorithms that have been recently developed to address them. We provide a comprehensive introduction to a large body of research, more than 200 key references, with the aim of supporting the further development of recommender systems exploiting information beyond the U-I matrix. On the basis of this material, we identify and discuss what we see as the central challenges lying ahead for recommender system technology, both in terms of extensions of existing techniques as well as of the integration of techniques and technologies drawn from other research areas."

However, most recommendation methods suit to the scenarios where explicit feedback, e.g. ratings, are available, but might not be suitable for the most common scenarios with only implicit feedback. In addition, most existing methods only focus on user and item dimensions and neglect any additional contextual information, such as time and location. In this paper, we propose a graph-based generic recommendation framework, which constructs a Multi-Layer Context Graph (MLCG) from implicit feedback data, and then performs ranking algorithms in MLCG for context-aware recommendation. Specifically, MLCG incorporates a variety of contextual information into a recommendation process and models the interactions between users and items. Moreover, based on MLCG, two novel ranking methods are developed: Context-aware Personalized Random Walk (CPRW) captures user preferences and current situations, and Semantic Path-based Random Walk (SPRW) incorporates semantics of paths in MLCG into random walk model for recommendation. The experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive k-nearest-neighbor (kNN). Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN. Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion."

Compared with the traditional collaborative filtering setting where the data have ratings, OCCF is more realistic in many scenarios when no ratings are available. In this paper, we propose to improve OCCF accuracy by exploiting the rich user information that is often naturally available in community-based interactive information systems, including a user\u2019s search query history, and purchasing and browsing activities. We propose two major strategies to incorporate such user information into the OCCF models: One is to linearly combine scores from different sources, and the other is to embed user information into collaborative filtering. Furthermore, we employ the MapReduce framework for similarity computation over millions of users and items. Experimental results on two large-scale retail datasets from a major e-commerce company show that the proposed methods are effective and can improve the performance of the OCCF over baseline methods through leveraging rich user information."

It helps users alleviate the information overload problem by recommending users with the personalized information, products or services (called items). Collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation algorithms have been widely deployed in e-commerce web sites. However, they both suffer from the scalability problem. In addition, there are few suitable similarity measures for the content-based recommendation methods to compute the similarity between items. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommendation algorithm by combing the content-based and collaborative filtering techniques as well as incorporating the coupled similarity. Our method firstly partitions items into several item groups by using a coupled version of k-modes clustering algorithm, where the similarity between items is measured by the Coupled Object Similarity considering coupling between items. The collaborative filtering technique is then used to produce the recommendations for active users. Experimental results show that our proposed hybrid recommendation algorithm effectively solves the scalability issue of recommender systems and provides a comparable recommendation quality when lacking most of the item features."

So far, most work relies on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solvers which are easy to derive, but in practice challenging to apply, especially for tasks with many items. For the simple matrix factorization model, an efficient coordinate descent (CD) solver has been previously proposed. However, efficient CD approaches have not been derived for more complex models. In this paper, we provide a new framework for deriving efficient CD algorithms for complex recommender models. We identify and introduce the property of k-separable models. We show that k-separability is a sufficient property to allow efficient optimization of implicit recommender problems with CD. We illustrate this framework on a variety of state-of-the-art models including factorization machines and Tucker decomposition. To summarize, our work provides the theory and building blocks to derive efficient implicit CD algorithms for complex recommender models."

Transactional context refers to the items that are observable in a transaction. Most existing transaction based recommender systems (TBRSs) make recommendations by mainly considering recently occurring items instead of all the ones observed in the current context. Moreover, they often assume a rigid order between items within a transaction, which is not always practical. More importantly, a long transaction often contains many items irreverent to the next choice, which tends to overwhelm the influence of a few truly relevant ones. Therefore, we posit that a good TBRS should not only consider all the observed items in the current transaction but also weight them with different relevance to build an attentive context that outputs the proper next item with a high probability. To this end, we design an effective attention based transaction embedding model (ATEM) for context embedding to weight each observed item in a transaction without assuming order. The empirical study on real-world transaction datasets proves that ATEM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and novelty.\n \n"

First, while previous RBM research has focused on modeling the correlation between item ratings, we model both user-user and item-item correlations in a unified hybrid non-IID framework. We further use real values in the visible layer as opposed to multinomial variables, thus taking advantage of the natural order between user-item ratings. Finally, we explore the potential of combining the original training data with data generated by the RBM-based model itself in a bootstrapping fashion. The evaluation on two MovieLens datasets (with 100K and 1M user-item ratings, respectively), shows that our RBM model rivals the best previously-proposed approaches."

Accordingly, semantic couplings (relatedness) have been recognized valuable for capturing the relationships between terms (words or phrases). Existing work focuses more on explicit relatedness, with respective models built. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive semantic similarity measure: Semantic Coupling Similarity (SCS), which (1) captures intra-term pair couplings within term pairs represented by patterns of explicit term co-occurrences in a document set, (2) extracts inter-term pair couplings between term pairs indicated by implicit couplings between term pairs through indirectly linked terms and paths between terms after term connections are converted to a graph presentation; and (3) semantic coupling similarity, integrating intra- and inter-term pair couplings towards a comprehensive capturing of explicit and implicit couplings between terms across documents. SCS caters for both synonymy and polysemy, and outperforms baseline methods consistently on all real data sets."

                "text": "Bayesian treatment of matrix factorization has been successfully applied to the problem of collaborative prediction, where unknown ratings are determined by the predictive distribution, inferring posterior distributions over user and item factor matrices that are used to approximate the user-item matrix as their product. In practice, however, Bayesian matrix factorization suffers from cold-start problems, where inferences are required for users or items about which a sufficient number of ratings are not gathered. In this paper we present a method for Bayesian matrix factorization with side information, to handle cold-start problems. To this end, we place Gaussian-Wishart priors on mean vectors and precision matrices of Gaussian user and item factor matrices, such that mean of each prior distribution is regressed on corresponding side information. We develop variational inference algorithms to approximately compute posterior distributions over user and item factor matrices. In addition, we provide Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound for our model, showing that the hierarchical Bayesian matrix factorization with side information improves the reconstruction over the standard Bayesian matrix factorization where the side information is not used. Experiments on MovieLens data demonstrate the useful behavior of our model in the case of cold-start problems."

Learning a good representation of mixed data is critical yet challenging for further learning tasks. Existing methods for representing mixed data often overlook the heterogeneous coupling relationships between categorical and continuous features as well as the discrimination between objects. To address these issues, we propose an auto-instructive representation learning scheme to enable margin-enhanced distance metric learning for a discrimination-enhanced representation. Accordingly, we design a metric-based auto-instructor (MAI) model which consists of two collaborative instructors. Each instructor captures the feature-level couplings in mixed data with fully connected networks, and guides the infinite-margin metric learning for the peer instructor with a contrastive order. By feeding the learned representation into both partition-based and density-based clustering methods, our experiments on eight UCI datasets show highly significant learning performance improvement and much more distinguishable visualization outcomes over the baseline methods.\n \n"

The metric learning of categorical data with hierarchical coupling relationships and local heterogeneous distributions is very challenging yet rarely explored. This paper proposes a Heterogeneous mEtric Learning with hIerarchical Couplings (HELIC for short) for this type of categorical data. HELIC captures both low-level value-to-attribute and high-level attribute-to-class hierarchical couplings, and reveals the intrinsic heterogeneities embedded in each level of couplings. Theoretical analyses of the effectiveness and generalization error bound verify that HELIC effectively represents the above complexities. Extensive experiments on 30 data sets with diverse characteristics demonstrate that HELIC-enabled classification significantly enhances the accuracy (up to 40.93 percent), compared with five state-of-the-art baselines."

                "text": "Coupled behaviors refer to the activities of one to many actors who are associated with each other in terms of certain relationships. With increasing network and community-based events and applications, such as group-based crime and social network interactions, behavior coupling contributes to the causes of eventual business problems. Effective approaches for analyzing coupled behaviors are not available, since existing methods mainly focus on individual behavior analysis. This paper discusses the problem of Coupled Behavior Analysis (CBA) and its challenges. A Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM)-based approach is illustrated to model and detect abnormal group-based trading behaviors. The CHMM models cater for: 1) multiple behaviors from a group of people, 2) behavioral properties, 3) interactions among behaviors, customers, and behavioral properties, and 4) significant changes between coupled behaviors. We demonstrate and evaluate the models on order-book-level stock tick data from a major Asian exchange and demonstrate that the proposed CHMMs outperforms HMM-only for modeling a single sequence or combining multiple single sequences, without considering coupling relationships to detect anomalies. Finally, we discuss interaction relationships and modes between coupled behaviors, which are worthy of substantial study."

Behavior interactions in a group are often associated with varying coupling relationships, for instance, conjunction or disjunction. Such coupling relationships challenge existing behavior representation methods, because they involve multiple behaviors from different actors, constraints on the interactions, and behavior evolution. In addition, the quality of behavior interactions are not checked through verification techniques. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based behavior modeling and checking system (OntoB for short) to explicitly represent and verify complex behavior relationships, aggregations, and constraints. The OntoB system provides both a visual behavior model and an abstract behavior tuple to capture behavioral elements, as well as building blocks. It formalizes various intra-coupled interactions (behaviors conducted by the same actor) via transition systems (TSs), and inter-coupled behavior aggregations (behaviors conducted by different actors) from temporal, inferential, and party-based perspectives. OntoB converts a behavior-oriented application into a TS and temporal logic formulas for further verification and refinement. We demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of the OntoB in modeling multirobot behaviors and their interactions in the Robocup soccer competition game. We show, that the OntoB system can effectively model complex behavior interactions, verify and refine the modeling of complex group behavior interactions in a sound manner."

Existing pattern-based outlier detection methods are ineffective in handling such complex scenarios, as they misfit such data. CBRW estimates outlier scores of feature values by modelling feature value level couplings, which carry intrinsic data characteristics, via biased random walks to handle this complex data. The outlier scores of feature values can either measure the outlierness of an object or facilitate the existing methods as a feature weighting and selection indicator. Substantial experiments show that CBRW can not only detect outliers in complex data significantly better than the state-of-the-art methods, but also greatly improve the performance of existing methods on data sets with many noisy features."
