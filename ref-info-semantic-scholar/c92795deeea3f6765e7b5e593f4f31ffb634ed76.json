We show that Kn(r)=B(n, r)Kn.r(0) and deduce that K\u201e(0)~(n-l)\\e-1 for large n and that K\u201e{r)~(n-\\)\\e-llr\\ if r=o(ri). An (n, q) digraph is one with n labelled nodes and q edges. From the result for Kn(r), we deduce that, if qn~3l2-\u00bboo as n-*ao, then almost all (n, q) digraphs are Hamiltonian. If qn~3,2-*c as #i-*co, then the proportion of (n, q) digraphs which are nonHamiltonian is at most 1 \u2014 exp(\u2014c~2) as \u00ab-\u00bb-co. An (n, q) digraph consists of n nodes and q directed edges. We consider only labelled digraphs, i.e. digraphs whose nodes are labelled. If A, B are two different nodes, they may be not joined or joined by the edge AB, or by the different edge BA or by both AB and BA. The greatest possible number of edges is N=n2\u2014n and the (n, N) digraph is called the complete digraph. We write B(h, k)=h\\/{k\\(h\u2014k)\\}, the usual binomial coefficient. Then obviously there are just B(N, q) different (n, q) digraphs. We call a sequence of n edges (1) AXA2, A2A3, A3At, , An_xAn, AnAx, (where Ax, \u2022 \u2022 \u25a0 , An are all the different n nodes of the graph) a Hamiltonian cycle (H.c.) and we say that a digraph which contains such a cycle is Hamiltonian. Our principal object is to find (so far as we can) for what q almost all (n, q) graphs are Hamiltonian. We write Kn(r) for the number of H.c. in the complete graph, each of which has just r edges in common with the specified H.c. in (1). The asymptotic approximation to Kn(r) for large n and appropriate r is essential to our method, which is otherwise that used by O'Neil [2] to study the Presented to the Society January 8, 1973 under the title Hamiltonian graphs and digraphs; received by the editors January 10, 1973.

These experiences made me aware that seemingly simple discrete optimization problems could hold the seeds of combinatorial explosions. The work of Dantzig, Fulkerson, Hoffman, Edmonds, Lawler and other pioneers on network flows, matching and matroids acquainted me with the elegant and efficient algorithms that were sometimes possible. Jack Edmonds\u2019 papers and a few key discussions with him drew my attention to the crucial distinction between polynomial-time and superpolynomial-time solvability. I was also influenced by Jack\u2019s emphasis on min-max theorems as a tool for fast verification of optimal solutions, which foreshadowed Steve Cook\u2019s definition of the complexity class NP. Another influence was George Dantzig\u2019s suggestion that integer programming could serve as a universal format for combinatorial optimization problems."

Here \u201creduced\u201d means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed."

It introduces the basic data structures and programming techniques often used in efficient algorithms. Covers use of lists, push-down stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Later chapters go into sorting, searching and graphing algorithms, the string-matching algorithms, and the Schonhage-Strassen integer-multiplication algorithm. Provides numerous graded exercises at the end of each chapter. \n \n \n0201000296B04062001"

In modern lanuage he considered the random graph G(n,.5) as described below. For each k-set S let BS denote the \u201cbad\u201d events that S is either a clique or an independent set.
