This is equivalent to thinking of the texture as a pattern painted on the surface. Three-dimensional textures, where the elements may point out of the surface, have largely been ignored. We study a special class of 3D textures, perpendicular textures where we can model the elements as being normal to the surface. The perspective projection of perpendicularly textured surfaces results in several interesting phenomena, which do not occur in the much-studied tangential texture case. These include occlusion, foreshortening and illumination. In this paper, we study the geometry of the problem, modeling the locations of the elements of the texture as being a realization of a spatial point process. Relations between slant and tilt of the surface, density and height of elements and occlusions are derived. Occlusions can now be used as a cue to infer shape, instead of being treated as a source of error."

In the conventional rendering algorithms various methods of approximate photometry are used whose domains of validity have been ill defined. We introduce the necessary photometric concepts and do a comparative study of rendering algorithms. In the computer graphics/vision literature the physically distinct causes of illuminance variation, namely, the obliqueness of surface elements and the effects of vignetting of extended sources, are thoroughly confused. This leads to serious errors when expressions are used in contexts outside their original realm. The treatment of the texture that is due to the illumination of surface mesostructure is an example. Erroneous results are obtained when simple expressions for the illuminance of convex bodies are interpreted in terms of equivalent sources and when these again are used in calculations involving different geometrical structures. We classify current methods in terms of the approximations (often implicitly) made and compare results for a large class of applications: that of surface mesostructure on convex objects. Large differences among the various approximative methods are found. We discuss simple methods that might be used to produce more realistic results at reasonable computational cost."

The spatial distribution of scattered light in relation to the incident light determines the surface appearance and can be partly specified by the bidirectional reflection distribution function, which is defined as the directionally dependent ratio of radiance to irradiance. We perform gonioradiometric measurements on samples of bricks and tiles. To describe the reflection mechanisms in the surfaces under study, we combine models of specular and diffuse reflectance from rough surfaces and fit them to the experimental data. We also collect images and determine the textural differences in the surface appearance, resulting from the variation in the illumination direction and the viewing directions."

These measurements were made using extremely high\u2010contrast photographs of a randomly rough model surface having known statistics. The illumination was quasicollimated incoherent light. The resulting photographs were measured by two different methods in order to determine the ratio of total area to shadowed area. Data are given for several surfaces having different mean\u2010square slopes. The resulting shadowing curves, given as a function of grazing angle, are compared with a theory developed by Wagner. The agreement was found to be generally good, and the theory for area reduction due to shadowing appears to be sufficiently accurate to warrant its incorporation in the theory of scattering from randomly rough surfaces."
