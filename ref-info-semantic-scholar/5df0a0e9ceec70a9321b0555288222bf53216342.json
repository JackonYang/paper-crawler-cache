Character recognition techniques help in recognizing the characters written on paper documents and converting it in digital form. Character recognition is gaining interest and importance in the modern world due to its application in various fields. Handwritten character recognition is a very difficult problem due to great variation of writing style, different size and shape of the character. Accuracy and efficiency are the major parameters in the field of handwritten character recognition. Neural network is a technique used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the handwritten character recognition system. This paper throws light on the improved neural network technique to recognize the offline handwritten characters."

This paper is conducted to propose ANN-ABC mixture algorithm in order to forecast the future discharge of Tang-e Karzin hydrometric station located in sub domain of salman farsi dam. A Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) was utilized to forecast the future discharge of a case study station using the 36 past years discharge information. Moreover, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization algorithm was applied within the training phase of the ANN network to optimize the weights of the MLP network. Through substitution of parameters of hidden layer (kind of activation function and number of neurons) of the neural network, best combination of parameters found in the first phase of the algorithm. Next in the second phase, artificial bee colony algorithm was used to find the global solution of the objective function of the problem. Simulation results indicated that ABC algorithm could significantly improve the neural network results."

                "text": "Groundwater is sensitive to the climate change and agricultural activities in arid and semi\u2010arid areas. Over the past several decades, human activities, such as groundwater extraction for irrigation, have resulted in aquifer overdraft and disrupted the natural equilibrium in these areas. Regional groundwater simulation is important to determine appropriate groundwater management policies, and numerical simulation has become the most popular method. However, most groundwater models were developed with static boundary conditions. In this research, the Minqin oasis, an arid region located in northwest China, was selected as the study area. An artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to simulate effects of weather conditions, agricultural activities and surface water on groundwater level in a dynamic boundary of the domain. Subsequently, a groundwater numerical model, named ANN\u2010FEFLOW model, was developed, with a dynamic boundary condition defined by the ANN model. The verifying results showed that the model has higher precision, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0\u00b771 m, relative error (RE) of 17\u00b796% and R2 of 0\u00b784 relative to the great groundwater change. Furthermore, the groundwater model has higher precision than the conventional groundwater model with static boundary condition, particularly in the area near the dynamic boundary. This study demonstrated that dynamic boundaries can improve the precision of the regional groundwater model in an arid area and that ANN can provide higher accuracy prediction capability for groundwater levels with dynamic boundary.
