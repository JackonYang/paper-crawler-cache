This thesis considers the problem of finding the global optimum of the response with few function evaluations. A small number of function evaluations is desirable since the computer model is often expensive (time consuming) to evaluate. \nThe function to be optimized is modeled as a stochastic process from initial function evaluations. Points are sampled sequentially according to a criterion that combines promising prediction values with prediction uncertainty. Some graphical tools are given that allow early assessment about whether the modeling strategy will work well. The approach is generalized by introducing a parameter that controls how global versus local the search strategy is. Strategies to conduct the optimization in stages and for optimization subject to constraints on additional response variables are presented. \nSpecial consideration is given to the stopping criterion of the global optimization algorithm. The problem of achieving a tolerance on the global minimum can be represented by determining whether the first order statistic of N dependent variables is greater than a certain value. An algorithm is developed that quickly determines bounds on the probability of this event. \nA strategy to explore high-dimensional data informally through effect plots is presented. The interpretation of the plots is guided by pointwise standard errors of the effects which are developed. When used in the context of global optimization, the graphical analysis sheds light on the number and location of local optima."

This method is meant to address optimization problems where the function has many extrema, where it may or may not be differentiable, and where it is important to reduce the number of evaluations of the function at the expense of increased computation. Comparisons are made to the performance of other global optimization techniques on a set of standard differentiable test functions. A new class of discrete-valued test functions is introduced, and the performance of the method is determined on a randomly generated set of these functions. Overall, this method has the power of other Bayesian/sampling techniques without the need for a separate local optimization technique for improved convergence. This makes it possible for the search to operate on unknown functions that may contain one or more discrete components. >"

By robust global behaviour we mean the mathematical assurance that the iterates produced by the optimization algorithm, started at an arbitrary initial iterate, will converge to a stationary point or local optimizer for the original problem. The approach presented is based on the trust region idea from nonlinear programming and is shown to be provably convergent to a solution of the original high-fidelity problem. The proposed method for managing approximations in engineering optimization suggests ways to decide when the fidelity, and thus the cost, of the approximations might be fruitfully increased or decreased in the course of the optimization iterations. The approach is quite general. We make no assumptions on the structure of the original problem, in particular, no assumptions of convexity and separability, and place only mild requirements on the approximations. The approximations used in the framework can be of any nature appropriate to an application; for instance, they can be represented by analyses, simulations, or simple algebraic models. This paper introduces the approach and outlines the convergence analysis."

It aims to minimize the number of probes required for a given confidence in the results. All known probes contribute to a stochastic model of the underlying score surface, and this model is interrogated for the location most likely to exceed the current result goal. The surface is assumed to be fractal, leading to a piecewise Gaussian model, where the local regions are defined by the Delaunay triangulation of the probes. The algorithm balances the competing aims of (1) sampling in the vicinity of known peaks, and (2) exploring new regions. Preliminary tests on a standard 2-D search problem were very encouraging.<<ETX>>"

It is assumed that the first derivatives are already available (e.g., from a sensitivity analysis) or can be produced by the code that implements the model. A Bayesian approach in which the random function that represents prior uncertainty about yo is taken to be a stationary Gaussian stochastic process is used.

An iiGA in combination with a finite element code is used to search for shape variations to optimize the Specific Energy Density of flywheels (SED is the rotational energy stored per unit mass). iiGA\u2019s seek solutions simultaneously at different levels of refinement of the problem representation (and correspondingly different definitions of the fitness function) in separate subpopulations (islands). Solutions are sought first at low levels of refinement with an axisymmetric plane stress finite element code for high-speed exploration of the coarse design space. Next, individuals are injected into populations with a higher level of resolution that uses an axisymmetric three-dimensional finite element model to \u201c fine-tune\u201d the flywheel designs. Solutions found for these various \u201ccoarse\u201d fitness functions on various nodes are injected into nodes that evaluate the ultimate fitness to be optimized Allowing subpopulations to explore different regions of the fitness space simultaneously allows relatively robust and efficient exploration in problems for which fitness evaluations are costly. First the paper treats a greatly simplified case \u2014 one for which all two million possible solutions were enumerated, yielding a known global optimum. Then the success and speed of many methods, including several variations of an iiGA, in finding this known global optimum are compared. The iiGA methods always found the global optimum, and the other methods never did. Hybridizing the iiGA with a local search operator and a Threshold Accepting (TA) search at the end of each generation provided the fastest solutions, without sacrificing robustness. Finally, a problem with a large design space is presented and results are compared for a hybrid iiGA to a parallel GA that uses a topological \u201cring\u201d structure. The hybrid iiGA greatly outperforms the topological \u201cring\u201d GA in terms of fitness and search efficiency for this given problem."

Given the input values, the code produces one or more outputs via a complex mathematical model. Often the code is expensive to run, and it may be necessary to build a computationally cheaper predictor to enable, for example, optimization of the inputs. If there are many input factors, an initial step in building a predictor is identifying (screening) the active factors. We model the output of the computer code as the realization of a stochastic process. This model has a number of advantages. First, it provides a statistical basis, via the likelihood, for a stepwise algorithm to determine the important factors. Second, it is very flexible, allowing nonlinear and interaction effects to emerge without explicitly modeling such effects. Third, the same data are used for screening and building the predictor, so expensive runs are efficiently used. We illustrate the methodology with two examples, both having 20 input variables. I..."

The motivating application is the design and analysis of computer experiments, where t determines the input to a computer model of a physical or behavioral system, and y(t) is a response that is part of the output or is calculated from it. Following a Bayesian formulation, prior uncertainty about the function y is expressed by means of a random function Y, which is taken here to be a Gaussian stochastic process. The mean of the posterior process can be used as the prediction function \u0177(t), and the variance can be used as a measure of uncertainty. This kind of approach has been used previously in Bayesian interpolation and is strongly related to the kriging methods used in geostatistics. Here emphasis is placed on product linear and product cubic correlation func..."

Ziegel (1998) was generally positive about Part A, other than some criticism of the audacity of a group of chemists who were essentially writing a statistics book. Unlike Part A, which emphasized data collection and focused mostly on standard univariate statistics topics, Part B is mostly concerned with multivariate statistics and their unique applications that arise in chemistry. In these areas, the chemists have made some significant contributions-most of them, in fact. So here in Part B one encounters QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationships), multivariate calibration, sensory data, pharmokinetic models, and many unique chemistry applications of mostly multivariate statistical procedures. These authors\u2019 expertise for this material is unquestionable. Though I credit the chemometricians with some imaginative use of mathematics and statistics, they do not need to present a large body of material on matrix algebra too. So the first chapter, here actually Chapter 29, serves up 52 superfluous pages. Thereafter I cannot fathom any logic in the presentation order of the topics. Chapter 30 is \u201cCluster Analysis,\u201d offered as straightforward statistics-book stuff. Chapter 31 is \u201cAnalysis of Measurement Tables.\u201d Because rows are observations and columns are variables, for these authors in this context this is just typical multivariate data. Mostly their data analysis is ordinary principal components, but nonlinear analysis and three-way tables are discussed too. Chapter 32 deals with a mostly mathematical matrix approach to the analysis of contingency tables, which ends with correspondence factor analysis and log-linear models. Shifting gears, the book next considers \u201cSupervised Pattern Recognition\u201d as Chapter 33. A wide-ranging set of topics begins with discriminant analysis and ends with neural networks. A fairly classical chemistry problem, resolution of curves and mixtures, provides the focus for Chapter 34. First standard factor-analysis methods are presented, followed by a host of variations and related techniques. Continuing to weave its way among topics, the book offers methods for relating many dependent variables to many independent variables as Chapter 35. These methods include Procrustes analysis, canonical correlation, multivariate regression, reduced rank regression, principal-components regression, partial least squares, and continuum regression. Chapter 36, \u201cMultivariate Calibration,\u201d follows naturally as a principal application. Shifting gears again, Chapter 37 is \u201cQSAR,\u201d which relies on methods discussed previously. Totally unrelated by application or techniques is \u201cAnalysis of Sensory Data,\u201d Chapter 38. Somewhat more related are the \u201cPharmokinetic Models\u201d of Chapter 39, a huge chapter mostly devoted to compartmental models. The next direction is \u201cSignal Processing\u201d in Chapter 40. Another lengthy chapter, it gives everything one could want to know about Fourier transforms, ending with a discussion of other deconvolution and transform methodologies. \u201cKalman Filtering\u201d follows as Chapter 41. The chapter begins with general material on recursive methods. The last part of the book starts with a rather useless chapter on operations research. The last two chapters, which cover artificial intelligence and neural networks, are a fitting conclusion to this modern update of chemometrics. These chapters, like all the others, have great sets of references, mostly to the chemical literature. There is a 12.page index. Part A of the set was a nice addition to my library, but, as a statistician, I did not need it. Topically, Part B, however, is really outstanding and seemingly very complete. Disregarding the few previous negative comments about topics inclusion and chapter organization, this book probably has everything I will ever want to know about chemometrics. Much as I hate to recommend that anyone plunk down $201 for a book, if one is involved in any way with chemometrics applications, its purchase is a must. It is as big as two books, which makes the price seem a little less exorbitant. Thanks to the six authors and Elsevier for undertaking this project and doing it very thoroughly."

This book by a teacher of statistics (as well as a consultant for \"experimenters\") is a comprehensive study of the philosophical background for the statistical design of experiment. It is necessary to have some facility with algebraic notation and manipulation to be able to use the volume intelligently. The problems are presented from the theoretical point of view, without such practical examples as would be helpful for those not acquainted with mathematics. The mathematical justification for the techniques is given. As a somewhat advanced treatment of the design and analysis of experiments, this volume will be interesting and helpful for many who approach statistics theoretically as well as practically. With emphasis on the \"why,\" and with description given broadly, the author relates the subject matter to the general theory of statistics and to the general problem of experimental inference.

Surface ozone levels are determined by the strengths of sources and precursor emissions and by meteorological conditions. Therefore, assessing ozone trends is complicated by meteorological variability. Ozone data in the Chicago area over the period 1981 to 1991 were studied. In this article, ozone concentration was modeled as a year effect plus a nonparametric model in meteorological variables. In this way, long-term trend over the 11-year period was separated from the effects of meteorology. Estimation of long-term trend is important for assessing the effectiveness of environmental policy. The indications were that there was a decrease in ozone levels once the meteorological effects on ozone had been adjusted for. The models based on this technique were also shown to provide predictions that closely match the actual ozone levels."
