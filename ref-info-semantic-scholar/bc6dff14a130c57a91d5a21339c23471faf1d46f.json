                "text": "Background South Africa's history and current social conditions suggest that mental disorders are likely to be a major contributor to disease burden, but there has been no national study using standardized assessment tools. Method The South African Stress and Health Study was a nationally representative in-person psychiatric epidemiological survey of 4351 adults (aged \u2a7e18 years) that was conducted as part of the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative between January 2002 and June 2004. Twelve-month prevalence and severity of DSM-IV disorders, treatment, and sociodemographic correlates were assessed with Version 3.0 of the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). Results The 12-month prevalence of any DSM-IV/CIDI disorder was 16.5%, with 26.2% of respondents with disorder classified as severe cases and an additional 31.1% as moderately severe cases. The most common disorders were agoraphobia (4.8%), major depressive disorder (4.9%) and alcohol abuse or dependence (4.5%). Twenty-eight percent of adults with a severe or moderately severe disorder received treatment compared to 24.4% of mild cases. Some 13.8% of persons with no disorder received treatment. Treatment was mostly provided by the general medical sector with few people receiving treatment from mental health providers. Conclusions Psychiatric disorders are much higher in South Africa than in Nigeria and there is a high level of unmet need among persons with severe and moderately severe disorders."

                "text": "Objective: This study examined the association between hyperactivity, aggression, and unintentional childhood injury among a cohort of children aged 5-12 years. Participants were recruited utilizing a two-tier randomization process from primary schools in Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland, Australia. Information on hyperactivity and aggression was collected by trained interviewers using a semi structured questionnaire and episodes of injury were reported by parents using an injury event report form. Eight hundred and seventy-one children were recruited into the study of which 811 (93%) completed the full 12 months of follow-up. All subsequent analysis was limited to the children who were retained for the full study period. Methods: One hundred and twenty-one children were categorized as hyperactive and 48 as aggressive. Boys were nearly twice as likely as girls to be categorized as hyperactive or aggressive, although this difference was not statistically significant for aggression. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) as measured by household income was also associated with aggression while more children from middle SES households as measured by both household income and maternal education were hyperactive compared with children from either low or high SES households. Results: After adjusting for key confounding factors, children with high hyperactivity scores had an increased risk of all injuries (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.48\u20132.64) and medically treated injuries (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.01\u20132.43). Male gender was also a significant predictor of injury. Initiatives to prevent childhood injuries should take into account that child temperament may act as a mediating factor in the injury pathway. Conclusion: Further research is necessary to determine the success of preventive efforts in higher risk children who may react to their environment in a substantially different manner compared with less hyperactive children."

Aims To determine if area factors are independently related to suicide risk after adjustment for individual and family characteristics. Method A 5-year record linkage study was conducted of 1 116 748 non-institutionalised individuals aged 16\u201374 years, enumerated at the 2001 Northern Ireland census. Results The cohort experienced 566 suicides during follow-up. Suicide risks were lowest for women and for those who were married or cohabiting. Indicators of individual and household disadvantage and economic and health status at the time of the census were also strongly related to risk of suicide. The higher rates of suicide in the more deprived and socially fragmented areas disappeared after adjustment for individual and household factors. There was no significant relationship between population density and risk of suicide. Conclusions Differences in rates of suicide between areas are predominantly due to population characteristics rather than to area-level factors, which suggests that policies targeted at area-level factors are unlikely to significantly influence suicides rates."

                "text": "Background The cognitive and academic outcomes of infants exposed to radiation after the meltdown at Chornobyl have been intensely debated. Western-based investigations indicate that no adverse effects occurred, but local studies reported increased cognitive impairments in exposed compared with non-exposed children. Our initial study found that at age 11 years, school grades and neuropsychological performance were similar in 300 children evacuated to Kiev as infants or in utero compared with 300 classmate controls, yet more evacuee mothers believed that their children had memory problems. This study re-examined the children's performance and academic achievement at age 19 years. Method In 2005\u20132006, we conducted an 8-year follow-up of the evacuees (n=265) and classmate controls (n=261) assessed in Kiev in 1997. Outcomes included university attendance, tests of intelligence, attention, and memory, and subjective appraisals of memory problems. Scores were standardized using a local population-based control group (n=327). Analyses were stratified by parental education. Results Evacuees and classmates performed similarly and in the normal range on all tests, and no differential temporal changes were found. The results were comparable for the in utero subsample. The rates of university attendance and self-reported memory problems were also similar. Nevertheless, the evacuee mothers were almost three times as likely to report that their children had memory problems compared with controls. Conclusions Chornobyl did not influence the cognitive functioning of exposed infants although more evacuee mothers still believed that their offspring had memory problems. These lingering worries reflect a wider picture of persistent health concerns as a consequence of the accident."

                "text": "Background The public health significance of mixed anxiety\u2013depressive disorder (MADD) and the distinctiveness of its phenomenology have yet to be established. Aims To determine the public health significance of MADD, and to compare its phenomenology with ICD-10 anxiety, depressive, and comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders. Method Weighted analysis of data from the Great Britain National Psychiatric Morbidity survey was conducted with a representative household sample of 8580 persons aged 16\u201374 years. Results The 1-month prevalence of MADD was 8.8%. A fifth of all days off work in Britain occurred in this group. The symptom profile of MADD was similar to \u2018pure\u2019 ICD-10 anxiety and depression, but with a lower overall symptom count. The disorder was associated with significant impairment of health-related quality of life. Differences in health-related quality of life measures between diagnostic groups were accounted for by overall symptom severity, which remained strongly associated with health-related quality of life measures after adjusting for diagnostic group. The finding that half of the anxiety, depression and MADD cases and a third of the comorbid depression and anxiety cases grouped into a single latent class challenges the notion of these conditions as having distinct phenomenologies. Mixed presentations may be the norm in the population. Conclusions The data support the pathological significance of MADD in its negative impact upon population health. Dimensional approaches to classification may provide a more parsimonious description of anxiety and depressive disorders compared with categorical approaches."

Potential events were identified in the adverse events database using a text-string search. Potential suicide-related events were categorized according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration-defined codes using blinded patient summaries. The meta-analyses used the Mantel-Haenszel incidence difference and Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo patient in atomoxetine attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) trials committed suicide. The frequency of suicidal ideation was 0.37% (5/1357) in pediatric patients taking atomoxetine versus 0% (0/851) for the placebo group; Mantel-Haenszel incidence difference of 0.46 (95% confidence interval 0.09-0.83; p =.016) and Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio of 2.92 (95% confidence interval 0.63-13.57; p =.172). Frequencies of suicide-related events in pediatric patients with ADHD did not differ between methylphenidate and atomoxetine treatments (Mantel-Haenszel incidence difference of -0.12 (95% confidence interval -0.62 to 0.38; p =.649). The number needed to harm in pediatric patients for an additional suicide-related event is 227 compared to the number needed to treat of five to achieve remission of ADHD symptoms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough uncommon, suicidal ideation was significantly more frequent in pediatric ADHD patients treated with atomoxetine compared to those treated with placebo. Retrospective analysis has limitations in ascertaining intent."

Beneficiaries initiating treatment for a major depressive episode were selected, excluding those who had recently received inpatient psychiatric treatment or outpatient treatment of pregnancy, major depressive episodes, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or other psychoses, mental retardation, dementia, or delirium or recent treatment with a mood stabilizer, antidepressant, or antipsychotic. The outcome was treatment for a suicide attempt during the first 120 days after starting treatment for a major depressive episode. Controls were matched to cases on age, sex, race/ethnicity, recent treatment of substance use disorder, severity and type of major depressive episode, and other factors. Separate analyses were performed for adults (aged 19 to 64 years) and children (aged 6 to 18 years).\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong children, antidepressant treatment was associated with a significant increase in suicide attempts (odds ratio [OR] = 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 4.10; cases, N = 51; controls, N = 239; p = .03). Among adults, antidepressant treatment was not significantly related to risk of suicide attempts (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.28; cases, N = 185; controls, N = 893; p = .44), although among adult males, antidepressants were associated with a significant protective effect (OR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.83; cases, N = 57; controls, N = 268; p = .01).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn these outpatients initiating treatment for a major depressive episode, antide-pressant treatment appears to be associated with an increased risk of treated suicide attempts in children and a decreased risk in adult males."

                "text": "BACKGROUND\nPrimary care is accessible and ideally placed for case finding of patients with lifestyle and mental health risk factors and subsequent intervention. The short self-administered Case-finding and Help Assessment Tool (CHAT) was developed for lifestyle and mental health assessment of adult patients in primary health care. This tool checks for tobacco use, alcohol and other drug misuse, problem gambling, depression, anxiety and stress, abuse, anger problems, inactivity, and eating disorders. It is well accepted by patients, GPs and nurses.\n\n\nAIM\nTo assess criterion-based validity of CHAT against a composite gold standard.\n\n\nDESIGN OF STUDY\nConducted according to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy statement for diagnostic tests.\n\n\nSETTING\nPrimary care practices in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\n\nMETHOD\nOne thousand consecutive adult patients completed CHAT and a composite gold standard. Sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResponse rates for each item ranged from 79.6 to 99.8%. CHAT was sensitive and specific for almost all issues screened, except exercise and eating disorders. Sensitivity ranged from 96% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 87 to 99%) for major depression to 26% (95% CI = 22 to 30%) for exercise. Specificity ranged from 97% (95% CI = 96 to 98%) for problem gambling and problem drug use to 40% (95% CI = 36 to 45%) for exercise. All had high likelihood ratios (3-30), except exercise and eating disorders.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCHAT is a valid and acceptable case-finding tool for most common lifestyle and mental health conditions."

Participants were light to moderate users of marijuana and represented a lower income population. Children were assessed with the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale by examiners blind to exposure status. Multiple regression was applied to examine the effects of prenatal marijuana exposure on children's intelligence after partialing out the effects of other significant predictors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was a significant nonlinear relationship between marijuana exposure and child intelligence. Heavy marijuana use (one or more cigarettes per day) during the first trimester was associated with lower verbal reasoning scores on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. Heavy use during the second trimester predicted deficits in the composite, short-term memory, and quantitative scores. Third-trimester heavy use was negatively associated with the quantitative score. Other significant predictors of intelligence included maternal IQ, home environment, and social support.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings indicate that prenatal marijuana exposure has a significant effect on school-age intellectual development."

Aims To evaluate the clinical effects of an integrated multidisciplinary diagnostic facility for psychogeriatric patients. Method Patients suspected of having complex psychogeriatric problems were randomly allocated to the intervention (n=137) or to treatment as usual (n=93). They were assessed at baseline, and at 6 months and 12 months follow-up by means of personal interviews with the patient's proxy. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life, assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) of the EuroQd measure, EQ-5D. Results Health-related quality of life had improved at 6 months in the intervention group, whereas that of the control group had decreased. Furthermore, more patients in the intervention group experienced a clinically relevant improvement of 10 points or more on the VAS at both follow-up measurements.

The purpose of this work was to determine whether a pediatric practice-based smoking prevention and cessation intervention increases abstinence rates among adolescents. METHODS. Eight pediatric primary care clinics were randomly assigned to either intervention or usual care control condition. The provider- and peer-delivered intervention tested was based on the 5A model recommended by the US Public Health Service clinical practice guidelines and the American Academy of Pediatrics and consisted of brief counseling by the pediatric provider followed by 1 visit and 4 telephone calls by older peer counselors aged 21 to 25 years. A consecutive sample of patients aged 13 to 17 years scheduled for an office visit was eligible regardless of smoking status. Of 2711 patients who agreed to participate, 2709 completed baseline assessments, and 2700 (99.6%) and 2690 (99.2%) completed 6- and 12-month assessments, respectively. RESULTS. Compared with the usual care condition, nonsmokers who received the provider- and peer-delivered intervention were significantly more likely to self-report having remained abstinent at 6-month and 12-month follow-up; smokers who received the provider- and peer-delivered intervention were more likely to report having quit at the 6-month but not the 12-month follow-up. A number of adolescent characteristics (eg, age, peer smoking, tobacco dependence, and susceptibility) were found to be predictive of abstinence at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. A pediatric practice-based intervention delivered by pediatric providers and older peer counselors proved feasible and effective in discouraging the initiation of smoking among nonsmoking adolescents for 1 year and in increasing abstinence rates among smokers for 6 months."

                "text": "Background Self-harm by young people is occurring with increasing frequency. Conventional in-patient and out-patient treatment has yet to be proved efficacious. Aims To investigate the efficacy of a short cognitive-behavioural therapy intervention with 90 adolescents and adults who had recently engaged in self-harm. Method Participants (aged 15\u201335 years) were randomly assigned to treatment as usual plus the intervention, or treatment as usual only. Assessments were completed at baseline and at 3 months, 6 months and 9 months follow-up. Results Patients who received cognitive-behavioural therapy in addition to treatment as usual were found to have significantly greater reductions in self-harm, suicidal cognitions and symptoms of depression and anxiety, and significantly greater improvements in self-esteem and problem-solving ability, compared with the control group. Conclusions These findings extend the evidence that a time-limited cognitive-behavioural intervention is effective for patients with recurrent and chronic self-harm."

                "text": "AIMS\nSmoking cessation programs are highly cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of programs for psychiatric patients may be affected by differences in cost, efficacy, survival and quality of life. We evaluated cost-effectiveness of a program for smokers being treated for depression.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA randomized trial compared brief contact to a stepped smoking cessation program in 322 cigarette smoking mental health out-patients. We determined the intervention's direct cost. Because smoking cessation may affect short-term use of mental health care, we used administrative databases and self-report to find mental health-care cost.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nThe 163 individuals randomized to stepped care received an average of $346 of smoking cessation services, including $221 for computer-mediated assessments of readiness to quit, and $124 for counseling, nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion. The cessation program was used by 53 participants. Total cost of smoking cessation and mental health services was $4805 in the stepped care group and $4173 in the brief-contact care group (not significantly different). After 18 months of follow-up, the stepped care group had 5.5% greater abstinence from smoking. Smoking cessation services cost $6204 per successful quit. Cessation services and mental health care cost was $11 496 per successful quit.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf smoking cessation yields 1.2 years additional life, the cessation services cost $5170 per life-year, and cessation services and mental health care cost $9580 per life-year. Even if quitting does not increase survival of depressed individuals as well as in other smokers, the stepped care intervention is likely to be regarded as cost-effective."

Youth (N = 161; 44% female; 85% Caucasian, 9% African American, 3% Hispanic, 3% other/mixed) with a principal diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder and their parents participated. Outcome analyses were conducted using hierarchical linear models on the intent-to-treat sample at posttreatment and 1-year follow-up using diagnostic severity, child self-reports, parent reports, and teacher reports. Chi-square analyses were also conducted on diagnostic status at post and 1-year follow-up. Children evidenced treatment gains in all conditions, although FCBT and ICBT were superior to FESA in reducing the presence and principality of the principal anxiety disorder, and ICBT outperformed FCBT and FESA on teacher reports of child anxiety. Treatment gains, when found, were maintained at 1-year follow-up. FCBT outperformed ICBT when both parents had an anxiety disorder.

                "text": "OBJECTIVE\nThe authors compared fluoxetine and placebo in continuation treatment to prevent relapse of major depressive disorder in children and adolescents.\n\n\nMETHOD\nAfter a detailed evaluation, children and adolescents 7-18 years of age with major depressive disorder were treated openly with fluoxetine. Those who had an adequate response after 12 weeks, as indicated by a Clinical Global Impression improvement score of 1 or 2 and a decrease of at least 50% in Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised score, were randomly assigned to receive fluoxetine or placebo for an additional 6 months. The primary outcome measures were relapse and time to relapse. Relapse was defined as either a score of 40 or higher on the Children's Depression Rating Scale with a history of 2 weeks of clinical deterioration, or clinical deterioration as judged by the clinician. Additional analyses were conducted with relapse defined only as a score of 40 or higher on the Children's Depression Rating Scale.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf 168 participants enrolled in acute fluoxetine treatment, 102 were randomly assigned to continuation treatment with fluoxetine (N=50) or placebo (N=52). Of these, 21 participants (42.0%) in the fluoxetine group relapsed, compared with 36 (69.2%) in the placebo group, a significant difference. Similarly, under the stricter definition of relapse, fewer participants in the fluoxetine group relapsed (N=11; 22.0%) than in the placebo group (N=25; 48.1%). Time to relapse was significantly shorter in the placebo group.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nContinuation treatment with fluoxetine was superior to placebo in preventing relapse and in increasing time to relapse in children and adolescents with major depression."

                "text": "OBJECTIVES\nTo determine if, in the short term, depressed adolescents attending routine NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), and receiving ongoing active clinical care, treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) plus cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) compared with SSRI alone, results in better healthcare outcomes.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted on depressed adolescents attending CAMHS who had not responded to a psychosocial brief initial intervention (BII) prior to randomisation.\n\n\nSETTING\nSix English CAMHS participated in the study.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 208 patients aged between 11 and 17 years were recruited and randomised.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nAll participants received active routine clinical care in a CAMHS outpatient setting and an SSRI and half were offered CBT.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe duration of the trial was a 12-week treatment phase, followed by a 16-week maintenance phase. Follow-up assessments were at 6, 12 and 28 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and Adolescents (HoNOSCA). Secondary outcome measures were self-report depressive symptoms, interviewer-rated depressive signs and symptoms, interviewer-rated psychosocial impairment and clinical global impression of response to treatment. Information on resource use was collected in interview at baseline and at the 12- and 28-week follow-up assessments using the Child and Adolescent Service Use Schedule (CA-SUS).\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 208 patients randomised, 200 (96%) completed the trial to the primary end-point at 12 weeks. By the 28-week follow-up, 174 (84%) participants were re-evaluated. Overall, 193 (93%) participants had been assessed at one or more time points. Clinical characteristics indicated that the trial was conducted on a severely depressed group. There was significant recovery at all time points in both arms. The findings demonstrated no difference in treatment effectiveness for SSRI + CBT over SSRI only for the primary or secondary outcome measures at any time point. This lack of difference held when baseline and treatment characteristics where taken into account (age, sex, severity, co-morbid characteristics, quality and quantity of CBT treatment, number of clinic attendances). The SSRI + CBT group was somewhat more expensive over the 28 weeks than the SSRI-only group (p=0.057) and no more cost-effective. Over the trial period there was on average a decrease in suicidal thoughts and self-harm compared with levels recorded at baseline. There was no significant increase in disinhibition, irritability and violence compared with levels at baseline. Around 20% (n=40) of patients in the trial were non-responders. Of these, 17 (43%) showed no improvement by 28 weeks and 23 (57%) were considered minimally (n=10) or moderately to severely worse (n=13).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor moderately to severely depressed adolescents who are non-responsive to a BII, the addition of CBT to fluoxetine plus routine clinical care does not improve outcome or confer protective effects against adverse events and is not cost-effective. SSRIs (mostly fluoxetine) are not likely to result in harmful adverse effects. The findings are broadly consistent with existing guidelines on the treatment of moderate to severe depression. Modification is advised for those presenting with moderate (6-8 symptoms) to severe depressions (>8 symptoms) and in those with either overt suicidal risk and/or high levels of personal impairment. In such cases, the time allowed for response to psychosocial interventions should be no more than 2-4 weeks, after which fluoxetine should be prescribed. Further research should focus on evaluating the efficacy of specific psychological treatments against brief psychological intervention, determining the characteristics of patients with severe depression who are non-responsive to fluoxetine, relapse prevention in severe depression and improving tools for determining treatment responders and non-responders."

Aims To assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine plus carbamazepine in mixed and manic bipolar episodes. Method Randomised, double-blind, 6-week trial of olanzapine (10\u201330 mg/day) plus carbamazepine (400\u20131200 mg/day; n=58) v. placebo plus carbamazepine (n=60) followed by open-label, 20-week olanzapine (10\u201330 mg/day) plus carbamazepine (400\u20131200 mg/day, n=86), with change in manic symptoms as main outcome measure. Safety and pharmacokinetics were also evaluated. Results There were no significant differences (baseline to endpoint) in efficacy measures between treatment groups, but at 6 weeks triglyceride levels were significantly higher (P=0.008) and potentially clinically significant weight gain (\u2a7e7%) occurred more frequently (24.6% v. 3.4%, P=0.002) in the combined olanzapine and carbamazepine group. Carbamazepine reduced olanzapine concentrations but olanzapine had no effect on carbamazepine concentrations. Conclusions The combination of olanzapine and carbamazepine did not have superior efficacy to carbamazepine alone. The increases in weight and triglycerides observed during combination treatment are a matter of concern."

Augmentation therapy was initiated with 18 mg of OROS methylphenidate and increased to a maximum dose of 54 mg of OROS methylphenidate until an optimal dose was achieved. Efficacy scales included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), 7 atypical items from the 31-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale, the CGI-Improvement scale (CGI-I), the Sex Effects scale, the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale, and the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Subjects were recruited at 17 community and academic centers across Canada. The study was conducted from June 8, 2005, to April 18, 2006.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the groups at endpoint on the MADRS. OROS methylphenidate was superior to placebo in improving apathy and fatigue as measured by the AES and the MAF. Statistically significant differences using mixed-model analysis were observed on the AES at all visits and at endpoint (p = .01) and on the MAF (p < .01). No differences were observed on other secondary measures, including the CGI-I and CGI-S. There were no clinically significant findings on electrocardiogram.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOROS methylphenidate did not demonstrate statistical significance on the MADRS at endpoint. Apathy and fatigue were significantly improved with OROS methylphenidate treatment, which was well tolerated with minimal side effects.\n\n\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00246233."

Problem gamblers (N = 180) were randomly assigned to assessment only control, 10 min of brief advice, 1 session of motivational enhancement therapy (MET), or 1 session of MET plus 3 sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Gambling was assessed at baseline, at 6 weeks, and at a 9-month follow-up. Relative to assessment only, brief advice was the only condition that significantly decreased gambling between baseline and Week 6, and it was associated with clinically significant reductions in gambling at Month 9. Between Week 6 and Month 9, MET plus cognitive-behavioral therapy evidenced significantly reduced gambling on 1 index compared with the control condition. These results suggest the efficacy of a very brief intervention for reduction of gambling among problem and pathological gamblers who are not actively seeking gambling treatment."

After a practice day, they received 6 days of D-MPH-ER 20 mg/day or placebo at home, returning on day 7 for one dose. Subjects were evaluated at predose and postdose hours 0.5, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 and then crossed over to the other treatment arm using the identical protocol. The primary efficacy variable was the change from predose in Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham rating scale (SKAMP) combined score from 1 to 12 hours. Secondary efficacy variables included SKAMP combined score at 0.5 hours, SKAMP subscale scores, and math test results over 12 hours.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixty-eight children were randomized, with 67 completing the study. Onset of action was indicated by a significant difference between D-MPH-ER and placebo at 0.5 hour on the SKAMP combined score (p = .001). For efficacy measures, differences from placebo were significant at all points between 0.5 and 12 hours (p < .001 top = .013).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nD-MPH-ER provided sustained improvement in attention, deportment, and academic productivity throughout the 12-hour laboratory day."

                "text": "OBJECTIVE. In this study we examined the effectiveness of atomoxetine for the treatment of oppositional defiant disorder comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. METHODS. Patients were aged 6 to 12 years and met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with a Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder subscale score above age and gender norms; Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale score of \u22654; and Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised oppositional defiant disorder subscale score of \u226515. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 1.2 mg/kg per day of atomoxetine (n = 156) or placebo (n = 70) for 8 weeks. Treatment effect on oppositional defiant disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms was measured by using the investigator-rated Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised. RESULTS. Repeated-measures analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference favoring atomoxetine over placebo in the reduction of Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised oppositional defiant disorder total scores. There were significant pairwise treatment differences at weeks 2 and 5 but not at week 8 postbaseline. A last-observation-carried-forward analysis showed Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale-Revised scores at endpoint for the atomoxetine and placebo groups were significantly different for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms but not for oppositional defiant disorder symptoms. Atomoxetine was superior to placebo in a last-observation-carried-forward analysis of Clinical Global Impression-Improvement and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scores. CONCLUSIONS. This study confirms previous findings that patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and comorbid oppositional defiant disorder show statistically and clinically significant improvement in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and global clinical functioning when treated with atomoxetine. It remains uncertain, however, whether atomoxetine exerts a specific and enduring effect on oppositional defiant disorder symptoms."

                "text": "OBJECTIVES\nSupported employment is an evidence-based practice that has proved to be consistently more effective than conventional vocational rehabilitation in helping people with severe mental illness find and sustain competitive employment. Most research on the effectiveness of supported employment comes from the United States. This study examined the effectiveness and applicability of a supported employment program based on the individual placement and support model in a Hong Kong setting.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNinety-two unemployed individuals with long-term mental illness who desired competitive employment were randomly assigned to either a supported employment program or a conventional vocational rehabilitation program and followed up for 18 months. Both vocational and nonvocational outcomes were measured.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver the 18-month study period, compared with participants in the conventional vocational rehabilitation program, those in the supported employment group were more likely to work competitively (70% versus 29%; odds ratio=5.63, 95% confidence interval=2.28-13.84), held a greater number of competitive jobs, earned more income, worked more days, and sustained longer job tenures. Repeated-measures analysis of variance found no substantive differences between participants in the two groups and no significant change from baseline over time for psychiatric symptoms and self-perceived quality of life.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nConsistent with previous research findings in the United States, the supported employment program was more effective than the conventional vocational rehabilitation program in helping individuals with long-term mental illness find and sustain competitive employment in a Hong Kong setting. The supported employment program based on the individual placement and support model can thus be recommended for wider use in local mental health practice."

                "text": "BACKGROUND\nThe most common psychiatric diagnosis among cancer patients is depression; this diagnosis is even more common among patients with advanced cancer. Psychotherapy is a patient-preferred and promising strategy for treating depression among cancer patients. Several systematic reviews have investigated the effectiveness of psychological treatment for depression among cancer patients. However, the findings are conflicting, and no review has focused on depression among patients with incurable cancer.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo investigate the effects of psychotherapy for treating depression among patients with advanced cancer by conducting a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\n\nSEARCH STRATEGY\nWe searched the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group Register, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases in September 2005.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nAll relevant RCTs comparing any kind of psychotherapy with conventional treatment for adult patients with advanced cancer were eligible for inclusion. Two independent review authors identified relevant studies.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently extracted data from the original reports using standardized data extraction forms. Two independent review authors also assessed the methodological quality of the selected studies according to the recommendations of a previous systematic review of psychological therapies for cancer patients that utilized ten internal validity indicators. The primary outcome was the standardized mean difference (SMD) of change between the baseline and immediate post-treatment scores.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified a total of ten RCTs (total of 780 participants); data from six studies were used for meta-analyses (292 patients in the psychotherapy arm and 225 patients in the control arm). Among these six studies, four studies used supportive psychotherapy, one adopted cognitive behavioural therapy, and one adopted problem-solving therapy. When compared with treatment as usual, psychotherapy was associated with a significant decrease in depression score (SMD = -0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.08 to -0.80). None of the studies focused on patients with clinically diagnosed depression.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nEvidence from RCTs of moderate quality suggest that psychotherapy is useful for treating depressive states in advanced cancer patients. However, no evidence supports the effectiveness of psychotherapy for patients with clinically diagnosed depression."
