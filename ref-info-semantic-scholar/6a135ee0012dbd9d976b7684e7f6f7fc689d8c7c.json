                "text": "A real recommender system can usually make use of more than one type of user feedback--for example, numerical ratings and binary ratings-to learn a user's true preferences. Recent work has proposed a transfer learning algorithm called transfer by collective factorization (TCF) to exploit such heterogeneous user feedback. TCF performs via sharing data-independent knowledge and modeling data-dependent effects simultaneously. However, TCF is a batch algorithm and updates the model parameters only once after scanning all data, which might not be efficient enough for real systems. This article proposes a novel and efficient transfer learning algorithm called interaction-rich transfer by collective factorization (iTCF), which extends the efficient collective matrix factorization (CMF) algorithm by providing more interactions between the user-specific latent features. The assumption under iTCF is that the predictability with regards to the same user's rating behaviors in two related data is likely to be similar. Considering the shared predictability, the authors derive novel update rules for iTCF in a stochastic algorithmic framework. The advantages of iTCF include its efficiency compared with TCF, and its higher prediction accuracy compared with CMF. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of iTCF over the state-of-the-art methods."

Since the data sparsity problem is quite commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering (CDCF) hence is becoming an emerging research topic in recent years. However, due to the lack of sufficient dense explicit feedbacks and even no feedback available in users' uninvolved domains, current CDCF approaches may not perform satisfactorily in user preference prediction. In this paper, we propose a generalized Cross Domain Triadic Factorization (CDTF) model over the triadic relation user-item-domain, which can better capture the interactions between domain-specific user factors and item factors. In particular, we devise two CDTF algorithms to leverage user explicit and implicit feedbacks respectively, along with a genetic algorithm based weight parameters tuning algorithm to trade off influence among domains optimally. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate our models and compare with other state-of-the-art models by using two real world datasets. The results show the superiority of our models against other comparative models."

We build on the assumption that different patterns characterize the way that users interact with i.e., rate or download items of a certain type e.g., movies or books. We view interactions with a specific type of item as constituting a particular domain and allow interaction information from an auxiliary domain to inform recommendation in a target domain. Our proposed approach is tested on a data set from Amazon and compared with a state-of-the-art approach that has been proposed for Cross-Domain Collaborative Filtering. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, which has a lower computational complexity, is able to achieve performance improvements."

In this paper, we propose a novel method, called User Graph regularized Pairwise Matrix Factorization (UGPMF), to seamlessly integrate user information into pairwise matrix factorization procedure. Due to the use of the available information on user side, we are able to find more compact, low dimensional representations for users and items. Experiments on real-world recommendation data sets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms various competing alternative methods on top-k ranking performance of one-class item recommendation task."

These systems often rely on Collaborating Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-K recommendation task."

Past work on Collaborative Filtering (CF) has either not addressed the ranking problem for binary relevance datasets, or not specifically focused on improving top-k recommendations. To solve the problem we propose a new CF approach, Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering (CLiMF). In CLiMF the model parameters are learned by directly maximizing the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which is a well-known information retrieval metric for measuring the performance of top-k recommendations. We achieve linear computational complexity by introducing a lower bound of the smoothed reciprocal rank metric. Experiments on two social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of CLiMF, and show that CLiMF significantly outperforms a naive baseline and two state-of-the-art CF methods."

In this paper, we propose a rating-matrix generative model (RMGM) for effective cross-domain collaborative filtering. We first show that the relatedness across multiple rating matrices can be established by finding a shared implicit cluster-level rating matrix, which is next extended to a cluster-level rating model. Consequently, a rating matrix of any related task can be viewed as drawing a set of users and items from a user-item joint mixture model as well as drawing the corresponding ratings from the cluster-level rating model. The combination of these two models gives the RMGM, which can be used to fill the missing ratings for both existing and new users. A major advantage of RMGM is that it can share the knowledge by pooling the rating data from multiple tasks even when the users and items of these tasks do not overlap. We evaluate the RMGM empirically on three real-world collaborative filtering data sets to show that RMGM can outperform the individual models trained separately."

In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive k-nearest-neighbor (kNN). Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN. Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion."

In this paper, we consider a novel approach for alleviating the sparsity problem in CF by transferring useritem rating patterns from a dense auxiliary rating matrix in other domains (e.g., a popular movie rating website) to a sparse rating matrix in a target domain (e.g., a new book rating website). We do not require that the users and items in the two domains be identical or even overlap. Based on the limited ratings in the target matrix, we establish a bridge between the two rating matrices at a cluster-level of user-item rating patterns in order to transfer more useful knowledge from the auxiliary task domain. We first compress the ratings in the auxiliary rating matrix into an informative and yet compact cluster-level rating pattern representation referred to as a codebook. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for reconstructing the target rating matrix by expanding the codebook. We perform extensive empirical tests to show that our method is effective in addressing the data sparsity problem by transferring the useful knowledge from the auxiliary tasks, as compared to many state-of-the-art CF methods."

ListRank-MF enjoys the advantage of low complexity and is analytically shown to be linear with the number of observed ratings for a given user-item matrix.

Transfer learning is proposed to extract and transfer knowledge from auxiliary data to improve the target learning task and has achieved great success in text mining, mobile computing, bioinformatics, etc. Collaborative filtering is a major intelligent component in various recommender systems, like movie recommendation in Netflix, news recommendation in Google News, people recommendation in Tencent Weibo (microblog), advertisement recommendation in Facebook, etc. However, in many collaborative filtering problems, we may not have enough data of users\u2019 preferences on items, which is known as the data sparsity problem. Transfer learning in collaborative filtering (TLCF) is studied to address the data sparsity problem in the user-item preference data in recommender systems. \nIn this thesis, we develop this new multidisciplinary area mainly from two aspects. First, we propose a general learning framework, study four new and specific problem settings for movie recommendation and people recommendation, and design four novel TLCF solutions correspondingly. We transfer knowledge from different types of auxiliary data based on a general regularization framework, and design batch algorithms, stochastic algorithms and distributed algorithms to solve the optimization problems. Second, we survey and categorize traditional transfer learning works into model-based transfer, instance-based transfer and feature-based transfer, and build a relationship between traditional transfer learning algorithms and TLCF solutions from a unified view of model-based transfer, instance-based transfer, and feature-based transfer."

We observe that, while our target data are sparse for CF systems, related and relatively dense auxiliary data may already exist in some other more mature application domains. In this paper, we address the data sparsity problem in a target domain by transferring knowledge about both users and items from auxiliary data sources. We observe that in different domains the user feedbacks are often heterogeneous such as ratings vs. clicks. Our solution is to integrate both user and item knowledge in auxiliary data sources through a principled matrix-based transfer learning framework that takes into account the data heterogeneity. In particular, we discover the principle coordinates of both users and items in the auxiliary data matrices, and transfer them to the target domain in order to reduce the effect of data sparsity. We describe our method, which is known as coordinate system transfer or CST, and demonstrate its effectiveness in alleviating the data sparsity problem in collaborative filtering. We show that our proposed method can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art solutions for this problem.\n \n"

To alleviate this problem, we present an item-based method for generating top-N recommendations that learns the item-item similarity matrix as the product of two low dimensional latent factor matrices. These matrices are learned using a structural equation modeling approach, wherein the value being estimated is not used for its own estimation. A comprehensive set of experiments on multiple datasets at three different sparsity levels indicate that the proposed methods can handle sparse datasets effectively and outperforms other state-of-the-art top-N recommendation methods. The experimental results also show that the relative performance gains compared to competing methods increase as the data gets sparser."

                "text": "Recommender systems based on latent factor models have been effectively used for understanding user interests and predicting future actions. Such models work by projecting the users and items into a smaller dimensional space, thereby clustering similar users and items together and subsequently compute similarity between unknown user-item pairs. When user-item interactions are sparse (sparsity problem) or when new items continuously appear (cold start problem), these models perform poorly. In this paper, we exploit the combination of taxonomies and latent factor models to mitigate these issues and improve recommendation accuracy. We observe that taxonomies provide structure similar to that of a latent factor model: namely, it imposes human-labeled categories (clusters) over items. This leads to our proposed taxonomy-aware latent factor model (TF) which combines taxonomies and latent factors using additive models. We develop efficient algorithms to train the TF models, which scales to large number of users/items and develop scalable inference/recommendation algorithms by exploiting the structure of the taxonomy. In addition, we extend the TF model to account for the temporal dynamics of user interests using highorder Markov chains. To deal with large-scale data, we develop a parallel multi-core implementation of our TF model. We empirically evaluate the TF model for the task of predicting user purchases using a real-world shopping dataset spanning more than a million users and products. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of using our TF models over existing approaches, in terms of both prediction accuracy and running time."

In this paper we present the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) model which scales linearly with the number of observations and, more importantly, performs well on the large, sparse, and very imbalanced Netflix dataset. We further extend the PMF model to include an adaptive prior on the model parameters and show how the model capacity can be controlled automatically. Finally, we introduce a constrained version of the PMF model that is based on the assumption that users who have rated similar sets of movies are likely to have similar preferences. The resulting model is able to generalize considerably better for users with very few ratings. When the predictions of multiple PMF models are linearly combined with the predictions of Restricted Boltzmann Machines models, we achieve an error rate of 0.8861, that is nearly 7% better than the score of Netflix's own system."

Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems and has been successfully employed in many applications. With the advent of online social networks, the social network based approach to recommendation has emerged. This approach assumes a social network among users and makes recommendations for a user based on the ratings of the users that have direct or indirect social relations with the given user. As one of their major benefits, social network based approaches have been shown to reduce the problems with cold start users. In this paper, we explore a model-based approach for recommendation in social networks, employing matrix factorization techniques. Advancing previous work, we incorporate the mechanism of trust propagation into the model. Trust propagation has been shown to be a crucial phenomenon in the social sciences, in social network analysis and in trust-based recommendation. We have conducted experiments on two real life data sets, the public domain Epinions.com dataset and a much larger dataset that we have recently crawled from Flixster.com. Our experiments demonstrate that modeling trust propagation leads to a substantial increase in recommendation accuracy, in particular for cold start users."

A challenge in link prediction is the data sparsity problem. In this paper, we address this problem by jointly considering multiple heterogeneous link prediction tasks such as predicting links between users and different types of items including books, movies and songs, which we refer to as the collective link prediction (CLP) problem. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian framework for solving the CLP problem, which allows knowledge to be adaptively transferred across heterogeneous tasks while taking into account the similarities between tasks. We learn the inter-task similarity automatically. We also introduce link functions for different tasks to correct their biases and skewness of distributions in their link data. We conduct experiments on several real world datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over several existing state-of-the-art methods."

                "text": "Relational learning is concerned with predicting unknown values of a relation, given a database of entities and observed relations among entities. An example of relational learning is movie rating prediction, where entities could include users, movies, genres, and actors. Relations encode users' ratings of movies, movies' genres, and actors' roles in movies. A common prediction technique given one pairwise relation, for example a #users x #movies ratings matrix, is low-rank matrix factorization. In domains with multiple relations, represented as multiple matrices, we may improve predictive accuracy by exploiting information from one relation while predicting another. To this end, we propose a collective matrix factorization model: we simultaneously factor several matrices, sharing parameters among factors when an entity participates in multiple relations. Each relation can have a different value type and error distribution; so, we allow nonlinear relationships between the parameters and outputs, using Bregman divergences to measure error. We extend standard alternating projection algorithms to our model, and derive an efficient Newton update for the projection. Furthermore, we propose stochastic optimization methods to deal with large, sparse matrices. Our model generalizes several existing matrix factorization methods, and therefore yields new large-scale optimization algorithms for these problems. Our model can handle any pairwise relational schema and a wide variety of error models. We demonstrate its efficiency, as well as the benefit of sharing parameters among relations."

However, applying factorization approaches to a new prediction problem is a nontrivial task and requires a lot of expert knowledge. Typically, a new model is developed, a learning algorithm is derived, and the approach has to be implemented.\n Factorization machines (FM) are a generic approach since they can mimic most factorization models just by feature engineering. This way, factorization machines combine the generality of feature engineering with the superiority of factorization models in estimating interactions between categorical variables of large domain. libFM is a software implementation for factorization machines that features stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and alternating least-squares (ALS) optimization, as well as Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monto Carlo (MCMC). This article summarizes the recent research on factorization machines both in terms of modeling and learning, provides extensions for the ALS and MCMC algorithms, and describes the software tool libFM."

                "text": "Accurate prediction of user behaviors is important for many social media applications, including social marketing, personalization, and recommendation. A major challenge lies in that although many previous works model user behavior from only historical behavior logs, the available user behavior data or interactions between users and items in a given social network are usually very limited and sparse (e.g., \u2a7e 99.9% empty), which makes models overfit the rare observations and fail to provide accurate predictions. We observe that many people are members of several social networks in the same time, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tencent\u2019s QQ. Importantly, users\u2019 behaviors and interests in different networks influence one another. This provides an opportunity to leverage the knowledge of user behaviors in different networks by considering the overlapping users in different networks as bridges, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem, and enhance the predictive performance of user behavior modeling. Combining different networks \u201csimply and naively\u201d does not work well. In this article, we formulate the problem to model multiple networks as \u201cadaptive composite transfer\u201d and propose a framework called ComSoc. ComSoc first selects the most suitable networks inside a composite social network via a hierarchical Bayesian model, parameterized for individual users. It then builds topic models for user behavior prediction using both the relationships in the selected networks and related behavior data. With different relational regularization, we introduce different implementations, corresponding to different ways to transfer knowledge from composite social relations. To handle big data, we have implemented the algorithm using Map/Reduce. We demonstrate that the proposed composite network-based user behavior models significantly improve the predictive accuracy over a number of existing approaches on several real-world applications, including a very large social networking dataset from Tencent Inc."

Examples include online dating, where people have the common goal of finding a partner, and employment websites where one group of users needs to find a job (employer) and another group needs to find an employee. People-to-people recommenders differ from the traditional items-to-people recommenders as they must satisfy both parties; we call this type of recommender reciprocal. This article is the first to present a comprehensive view of this important recommender class. We first identify the characteristics of reciprocal recommenders and compare them with traditional recommenders, which are widely used in e-commerce websites. We then present a series of studies and evaluations of a content-based reciprocal recommender in the domain of online dating. It uses a large dataset from a major online dating website. We use this case study to illustrate the distinctive requirements of reciprocal recommenders and highlight important challenges, such as the need to avoid bad recommendations since they may make users to feel rejected. Our experiments indicate that, by considering reciprocity, the rate of successful connections can be significantly improved. They also show that, despite the existence of rich explicit profiles, the use of implicit profiles provides more effective recommendations. We conclude with a discussion, linking our work in online dating to the many other domains that require reciprocal recommenders. Our key contributions are the recognition of the reciprocal recommender as an important class of recommender, the identification of its distinctive characteristics and the exploration of how these impact the recommendation process in an extensive case study in the domain of online dating."

To the best of our knowledge, however, none of these provides information taking into account user preferences, or other elements, in addition to location, that contribute to define the context of use. The provided suggestions do not consider, for example, time, day of week, weather, user activity or means of transport. This article describes a social recommender system able to identify user preferences and information needs, thus suggesting personalized recommendations related to POIs in the surroundings of the user's current location. The proposed approach achieves the following goals: (i) to supply, unlike the current LBSs, a methodology for identifying user preferences and needs to be used in the information filtering process; (ii) to exploit the ever-growing amount of information from social networking, user reviews, and local search Web sites; (iii) to establish procedures for defining the context of use to be employed in the recommendation of POIs with low effort. The flexibility of the architecture is such that our approach can be easily extended to any category of POI. Experimental tests carried out on real users enabled us to quantify the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of performance improvement."

                "text": "\n \n Transfer learning as a new machine learning paradigm has gained increasing attention lately. In situations where the training data in a target domain are not sufficient to learn predictive models effectively, transfer learning leverages auxiliary source data from other related source domains for learning. While most of the existing works in this area only focused on using the source data with the same structure as the target data, in this paper, we push this boundary further by proposing a heterogeneous transfer learning framework for knowledge transfer between text and images. We observe that for a target-domain classification problem, some annotated images can be found on many social Web sites, which can serve as a bridge to transfer knowledge from the abundant text documents available over the Web. A key question is how to effectively transfer the knowledge in the source data even though the text can be arbitrarily found. Our solution is to enrich the representation of the target images with semantic concepts extracted from the auxiliary source data through a novel matrix factorization method. By using the latent semantic features generated by the auxiliary data, we are able to build a better integrated image classifier. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on the Caltech-256 image dataset.\n \n"

This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it. Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general -- all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application. This book explains: Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or mediaMethods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large datasetSearch engine features -- crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the PageRank algorithmOptimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best oneBayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other featuresUsing decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are madePredicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price modelsSupport vector machines to match people in online dating sitesNon-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in a datasetEvolving intelligence for problem solving -- how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game Each chapter includes exercises for extending the algorithms to make them more powerful. Go beyond simple database-backed applications and put the wealth of Internet data to work for you. \"Bravo! I cannot think of a better way for a developer to first learn these algorithms and methods, nor can I think of a better way for me (an old AI dog) to reinvigorate my knowledge of the details.\" -- Dan Russell, Google \"Toby's book does a great job of breaking down the complex subject matter of machine-learning algorithms into practical, easy-to-understand examples that can be directly applied to analysis of social interaction across the Web today. If I had this book two years ago, it would have saved precious time going down some fruitless paths.\" -- Tim Wolters, CTO, Collective Intellect"

However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research."

With more than 100,000 papers published each year just in computer science, performing a complete literature search becomes a Herculean task. Some of the existing approaches and tools for literature search cannot compete with the characteristics of today\u2019s literature, and they suffer from ambiguity and homonymy. Techniques based on citation information are more robust to the mentioned issues. Thus, we recently built a Web service called the advisor, which provides personalized recommendations to researchers based on their papers of interest. Since most recommendation methods may return redundant results, diversifying the results of the search process is necessary to increase the amount of information that one can reach via an automated search. This article targets the problem of result diversification in citation-based bibliographic search, assuming that the citation graph itself is the only information available and no categories or intents are known. The contribution of this work is threefold. We survey various random walk--based diversification methods and enhance them with the direction awareness property to allow users to reach either old, foundational (possibly well-cited and well-known) research papers or recent (most likely less-known) ones. Next, we propose a set of novel algorithms based on vertex selection and query refinement. A set of experiments with various evaluation criteria shows that the proposed \u03b3-RLM algorithm performs better than the existing approaches and is suitable for real-time bibliographic search in practice."

However, in many cases, this identical-distribution assumption does not hold. The assumption might be violated when a task from one new domain comes, while there are only labeled data from a similar old domain. Labeling the new data can be costly and it would also be a waste to throw away all the old data. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning framework called TrAdaBoost, which extends boosting-based learning algorithms (Freund & Schapire, 1997). TrAdaBoost allows users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone. We show that TrAdaBoost allows knowledge to be effectively transferred from the old data to the new. The effectiveness of our algorithm is analyzed theoretically and empirically to show that our iterative algorithm can converge well to an accurate model."

Decompositions of higher-order tensors (i.e., $N$-way arrays with $N \\geq 3$) have applications in psycho-metrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer vision, numerical analysis, data mining, neuroscience, graph analysis, and elsewhere. Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors."

The reactions are called annotations; they can be accessed by other people\u2019s filters. Tapestry is intended to handle any incoming stream of electronic documents and serves both as a mail filter and repository; its components are the indexer, document store, annotation store, filterer, little box, remailer, appraiser and reader/browser.

For modeling user feedback in such settings, a common approach is to consider items acted upon to be relevant to the user, and irrelevant otherwise. However, clicking some but not others conveys an implicit ordering of the presented items. Pairwise learning, which leverages such implicit ordering between a pair of items, has been successful in areas such as search ranking. In this work, we study whether pairwise learning can improve community recommendation. We first present two novel pairwise models adapted from logistic regression. Both offline and online experiments in a large real-world setting show that incorporating pairwise learning improves the recommendation performance. However, the improvement is only slight. We find that users' preferences regarding the kinds of communities they like can differ greatly, which adversely affect the effectiveness of features derived from pairwise comparisons. We therefore propose a probabilistic latent semantic indexing model for pairwise learning (Pairwise PLSI), which assumes a set of users' latent preferences between pairs of items. Our experiments show favorable results for the Pairwise PLSI model and point to the potential of using pairwise learning for community recommendation."
