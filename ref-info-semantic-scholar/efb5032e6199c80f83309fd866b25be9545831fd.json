We study the effect of limited precision data representation and computation on neural network training. Within the context of low-precision fixed-point computations, we observe the rounding scheme to play a crucial role in determining the network's behavior during training. Our results show that deep networks can be trained using only 16-bit wide fixed-point number representation when using stochastic rounding, and incur little to no degradation in the classification accuracy. We also demonstrate an energy-efficient hardware accelerator that implements low-precision fixed-point arithmetic with stochastic rounding."

For each of those datasets and for each of those formats, we assess the impact of the precision of the storage on the final error of the training. We find that very low precision storage is sufficient not just for running trained networks but also for training them. For example, Maxout networks state-of-the-art results are nearly maintained with 10 bits for storing activations and gradients, and 12 bits for storing parameters."

Recent efforts to train extremely large networks (with over 1 billion parameters) have relied on cloudlike computing infrastructure and thousands of CPU cores. In this paper, we present technical details and results from our own system based on Commodity Off-The-Shelf High Performance Computing (COTS HPC) technology: a cluster of GPU servers with Infiniband interconnects and MPI. Our system is able to train 1 billion parameter networks on just 3 machines in a couple of days, and we show that it can scale to networks with over 11 billion parameters using just 16 machines. As this infrastructure is much more easily marshaled by others, the approach enables much wider-spread research with extremely large neural networks."

Indeed, much progress has been made on benchmark datasets like NORB and CIFAR by employing increasingly complex unsupervised learning algorithms and deep models. In this paper, however, we show that several simple factors, such as the number of hidden nodes in the model, may be more important to achieving high performance than the learning algorithm or the depth of the model. Specifically, we will apply several othe-shelf feature learning algorithms (sparse auto-encoders, sparse RBMs, K-means clustering, and Gaussian mixtures) to CIFAR, NORB, and STL datasets using only singlelayer networks. We then present a detailed analysis of the eect of changes in the model setup: the receptive field size, number of hidden nodes (features), the step-size (\u201cstride\u201d) between extracted features, and the eect of whitening. Our results show that large numbers of hidden nodes and dense feature extraction are critical to achieving high performance\u2014so critical, in fact, that when these parameters are pushed to their limits, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both CIFAR-10 and NORB using only a single layer of features. More surprisingly, our best performance is based on K-means clustering, which is extremely fast, has no hyperparameters to tune beyond the model structure itself, and is very easy to implement. Despite the simplicity of our system, we achieve accuracy beyond all previously published results on the CIFAR-10 and NORB datasets (79.6% and 97.2% respectively)."

These models deliver impressive accuracy, but each image evaluation requires millions of floating point operations, making their deployment on smartphones and Internet-scale clusters problematic. The computation is dominated by the convolution operations in the lower layers of the model. We exploit the redundancy present within the convolutional filters to derive approximations that significantly reduce the required computation. Using large state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate speedups of convolutional layers on both CPU and GPU by a factor of 2 x, while keeping the accuracy within 1% of the original model."

For each of those datasets and for each of those formats, we assess the impact of the precision of the multiplications on the final error after training. We find that very low precision is sufficient not just for running trained networks but also for training them. For example, it is possible to train Maxout networks with 10 bits multiplications."

For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200\u00d7200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting from these learned features, we trained our network to recognize 22,000 object categories from ImageNet and achieve a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art."

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets."

To learn these representations we introduce nested dropout, a procedure for stochastically removing coherent nested sets of hidden units in a neural network. We first present a sequence of theoretical results for the special case of a semilinear autoencoder. We rigorously show that the application of nested dropout enforces identifiability of the units, which leads to an exact equivalence with PCA. We then extend the algorithm to deep models and demonstrate the relevance of ordered representations to a number of applications. Specifically, we use the ordered property of the learned codes to construct hash-based data structures that permit very fast retrieval, achieving retrieval in time logarithmic in the database size and independent of the dimensionality of the representation. This allows codes that are hundreds of times longer than currently feasible for retrieval. We therefore avoid the diminished quality associated with short codes, while still performing retrieval that is competitive in speed with existing methods. We also show that ordered representations are a promising way to learn adaptive compression for efficient online data reconstruction."

For each of those datasets and for each of those arithmetics, we assess the impact of the precision of the computations on the final error of the training. We find that very low precision computation is sufficient not just for running trained networks but also for training them. For example, almost state-of-the-art results were obtained on most datasets with 10 bits for computing activations and gradients, and 12 bits for storing updated parameters."

Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efficient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured."

Simple versions of this approach include penalizing the sum of the squares of the weights or penalizing the number of nonzero weights. We propose a more complicated penalty term in which the distribution of weight values is modeled as a mixture of multiple gaussians. A set of weights is simple if the weights have high probability density under the mixture model. This can be achieved by clustering the weights into subsets with the weights in each cluster having very similar values. Since we do not know the appropriate means or variances of the clusters in advance, we allow the parameters of the mixture model to adapt at the same time as the network learns. Simulations on two different problems demonstrate that this complexity term is more effective than previous complexity terms."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

During training, DAEs make many passes over the training dataset and reconstruct it from partial corruption generated from a pre-specified corrupting distribution. This process learns robust representation, though at the expense of requiring many training epochs, in which the data is explicitly corrupted. In this paper we present the marginalized Denoising Auto-encoder (mDAE), which (approximately) marginalizes out the corruption during training. Effectively, the mDAE takes into account infinitely many corrupted copies of the training data in every epoch, and therefore is able to match or outperform the DAE with much fewer training epochs. We analyze our proposed algorithm and show that it can be understood as a classic auto-encoder with a special form of regularization. In empirical evaluations we show that it attains 1-2 order-of-magnitude speedup in training time over other competing approaches."

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel."

This paper adds to the mounting evidence that this is indeed the case. We report on a series of experiments conducted for different recognition tasks using the publicly available code and model of the OverFeat network which was trained to perform object classification on ILSVRC13. We use features extracted from the OverFeat network as a generic image representation to tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of object image classification, scene recognition, fine grained recognition, attribute detection and image retrieval applied to a diverse set of datasets. We selected these tasks and datasets as they gradually move further away from the original task and data the OverFeat network was trained to solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent superior results compared to the highly tuned state-of-the-art systems in all the visual classification tasks on various datasets. For instance retrieval it consistently outperforms low memory footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results are achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or L2 distance in case of retrieval) applied to a feature representation of size 4096 extracted from a layer in the net. The representations are further modified using simple augmentation techniques e.g. jittering. The results strongly suggest that features obtained from deep learning with convolutional nets should be the primary candidate in most visual recognition tasks."

This expressiveness comes at a price: During test-time, the SVM classifier needs to compute the kernel inner-product between a test sample and all support vectors. With large training data sets, the time required for this computation can be substantial. In this paper, we introduce a post-processing algorithm, which compresses the learned SVM model by reducing and optimizing support vectors. We evaluate our algorithm on several medium-scaled real-world data sets, demonstrating that it maintains high test accuracy while reducing the test-time evaluation cost by several orders of magnitude---in some cases from hours to seconds. It is fair to say that most of the work in this paper was previously been invented by Burges and Sch\\\"olkopf almost 20 years ago. For most of the time during which we conducted this research, we were unaware of this prior work. However, in the past two decades, computing power has increased drastically, and we can therefore provide empirical insights that were not possible in their original paper."

They can be trained to model windows of coefficients extracted from speech and they discover multiple layers of features that capture the higher-order statistical structure of the data. These features can be used to initialize the hidden units of a feed-forward neural network that is then trained to predict the HMM state for the central frame of the window. Initializing with features that are good at generating speech makes the neural network perform much better than initializing with random weights. DBNs have already been used successfully for phone recognition with input coefficients that are MFCCs or filterbank outputs [1, 2]. In this paper, we demonstrate that they work even better when their inputs are speaker adaptive, discriminative features. On the standard TIMIT corpus, they give phone error rates of 19.6% using monophone HMMs and a bigram language model and 19.4% using monophone HMMs and a trigram language model."

Given only a few weight values for each feature it is possible to accurately predict the remaining values. Moreover, we show that not only can the parameter values be predicted, but many of them need not be learned at all. We train several different architectures by learning only a small number of weights and predicting the rest. In the best case we are able to predict more than 95% of the weights of a network without any drop in accuracy."

However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets."

End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score."

In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art."

Unfortunately, this tuning is often a \"black art\" requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks."

Reviews can span so many different domains that it is difficult to gather annotated training data for all of them. Hence, this paper studies the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers, hereby a system is trained on labeled reviews from one source domain but is meant to be deployed on another. We propose a deep learning approach which learns to extract a meaningful representation for each review in an unsupervised fashion. Sentiment classifiers trained with this high-level feature representation clearly outperform state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark composed of reviews of 4 types of Amazon products. Furthermore, this method scales well and allowed us to successfully perform domain adaptation on a larger industrial-strength dataset of 22 domains."

                "text": "Low-power sensing technologies have emerged for acquiring physiologically indicative patient signals. However, to enable devices with high clinical value, a critical requirement is the ability to analyze the signals to extract specific medical information. Yet given the complexities of the underlying processes, signal analysis poses numerous challenges. Data-driven methods based on machine learning offer distinct solutions, but unfortunately the computations are not well supported by traditional DSP. This paper presents a custom processor that integrates a CPU with configurable accelerators for discriminative machine-learning functions. A support-vector-machine accelerator realizes various classification algorithms as well as various kernel functions and kernel formulations, enabling range of points within an accuracy-versus-energy and -memory trade space. An accelerator for embedded active learning enables prospective adaptation of the signal models by utilizing sensed data for patient-specific customization, while minimizing the effort from human experts. The prototype is implemented in 130-nm CMOS and operates from 1.2 V-0.55 V (0.7 V for SRAMs). Medical applications for EEG-based seizure detection and ECG-based cardiac-arrhythmia detection are demonstrated using clinical data, while consuming 273 \u03bcJ and 124 \u03bcJ per detection, respectively; this represents 62.4&times; and 144.7&times; energy reduction compared to an implementation based on the CPU. A patient-adaptive cardiac-arrhythmia detector is also demonstrated, reducing the analysis-effort required for model customization by 20 &times;."

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible."

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

Compared with other existing methods, FFD has unmatched advantages, as it attains the efficiency and interpretability of linear models as well as the accuracy of nonlinear models. It is also sparse and naturally handles mixed data types. It works by decomposing the kernel density estimation in the entire feature space into selected low-dimensional subspaces. Since there are many possible subspaces, we propose a submodular optimization framework for subspace selection. The selected subspace predictions are then transformed to new features on which a linear model can be learned. Besides, since the transformed features naturally expect non-negative weights, we only require smooth optimization even with the L1 regularization. Unlike other nonlinear models such as kernel methods, the FFD model is interpretable as it gives importance weights on the original features. Its training and testing are also much faster than traditional kernel models. We carry out extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets and show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art classification results with sparsity, interpretability, and exceptional scalability. Our model can be learned in minutes on datasets with millions of samples, for which most existing nonlinear methods will be prohibitively expensive in space and time."

We show how a multiscale and sliding window approach can be efficiently implemented within a ConvNet. We also introduce a novel deep learning approach to localization by learning to predict object boundaries. Bounding boxes are then accumulated rather than suppressed in order to increase detection confidence. We show that different tasks can be learned simultaneously using a single shared network. This integrated framework is the winner of the localization task of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013) and obtained very competitive results for the detection and classifications tasks. In post-competition work, we establish a new state of the art for the detection task. Finally, we release a feature extractor from our best model called OverFeat."

Our approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions outperform retrieval baselines on both full images and on a new dataset of region-level annotations. Finally, we conduct large-scale analysis of our RNN language model on the Visual Genome dataset of 4.1 million captions and highlight the differences between image and region-level caption statistics."

It has been successfully applied to a variety of problems, including hyperparameter tuning and experimental design. However, this framework has not been extended to the inequality-constrained optimization setting, particularly the setting in which evaluating feasibility is just as expensive as evaluating the objective. Here we present constrained Bayesian optimization, which places a prior distribution on both the objective and the constraint functions. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, demonstrating that constrained Bayesian optimization can quickly find optimal and feasible points, even when small feasible regions cause standard methods to fail."
