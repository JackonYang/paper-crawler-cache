In high-level synthesis, the quality of the generated circuit relates directly to the code generated by the front-end compiler. Choosing a good order\u2013often referred to as the phase-ordering problem\u2013is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we evaluate a new technique to address the phase-ordering problem: deep reinforcement learning. We implement a framework in the context of the LLVM compiler to optimize the ordering for HLS programs and compare the performance of deep reinforcement learning to state-of-the-art algorithms that address the phase-ordering problem. Overall, our framework runs one to two orders of magnitude faster than these algorithms, and achieves a 16% improvement in circuit performance over the -O3 compiler flag."

Furthermore, choosing the correct order in which to apply those optimizations has been a long standing problem in compilation research. Each of these optimizations interacts with the code and in turn with all other optimizations in complicated ways. Traditional compilers typically apply the same set of optimization in a fixed order to all functions in a program, without regard the code being optimized.\n Understanding the interactions of optimizations is very important in determining a good solution to the phase-ordering problem. This paper develops a new approach that automatically selects good optimization orderings on a per method basis within a dynamic compiler. Our approach formulates the phase-ordering problem as a Markov process and uses a characterization of the current state of the code being optimized to creating a better solution to the phase ordering problem. Our technique uses neuro-evolution to construct an artificial neural network that is capable of predicting beneficial optimization ordering for a piece of code that is being optimized. We implemented our technique in Jikes RVM and achieved significant improvements on a set of standard Java benchmarks over a well-engineered fixed order."

                "text": "One of the key challenges arising when compilers vectorize loops for today\u2019s SIMD-compatible architectures is to decide if vectorization or interleaving is beneficial. Then, the compiler has to determine the number of instructions to pack together and the interleaving level (stride). Compilers are designed today to use fixed-cost models that are based on heuristics to make vectorization decisions on loops. However, these models are unable to capture the data dependency, the computation graph, or the organization of instructions. Alternatively, software engineers often hand-write the vectorization factors of every loop. This, however, places a huge burden on them, since it requires prior experience and significantly increases the development time. In this work, we explore a novel approach for handling loop vectorization and propose an end-to-end solution using deep reinforcement learning (RL). We conjecture that deep RL can capture different instructions, dependencies, and data structures to enable learning a sophisticated model that can better predict the actual performance cost and determine the optimal vectorization factors. We develop an end-to-end framework, from code to vectorization, that integrates deep RL in the LLVM compiler. Our proposed framework takes benchmark codes as input and extracts the loop codes. These loop codes are then fed to a loop embedding generator that learns an embedding for these loops. Finally, the learned embeddings are used as input to a Deep RL agent, which dynamically determines the vectorization factors for all the loops. We further extend our framework to support random search, decision trees, supervised neural networks, and nearest-neighbor search. We evaluate our approaches against the currently used LLVM vectorizer and loop polyhedral optimization techniques. Our experiments show 1.29\u00d7\u22124.73\u00d7 performance speedup compared to baseline and only 3% worse than the brute-force search on a wide range of benchmarks."

                "text": "Tuning compiler optimizations for rapidly evolving hardware makes porting and extending an optimizing compiler for each new platform extremely challenging. Iterative optimization is a popular approach to adapting programs to a new architecture automatically using feedback-directed compilation. However, the large number of evaluations required for each program has prevented iterative compilation from widespread take-up in production compilers. Machine learning has been proposed to tune optimizations across programs systematically but is currently limited to a few transformations, long training phases and critically lacks publicly released, stable tools. Our approach is to develop a modular, extensible, self-tuning optimization infrastructure to automatically learn the best optimizations across multiple programs and architectures based on the correlation between program features, run-time behavior and optimizations. In this paper we describe Milepost GCC, the first publicly-available open-source machine learning-based compiler. It consists of an Interactive Compilation Interface (ICI) and plugins to extract program features and exchange optimization data with the cTuning.org open public repository. It automatically adapts the internal optimization heuristic at function-level granularity to improve execution time, code size and compilation time of a new program on a given architecture. Part of the MILEPOST technology together with low-level ICI-inspired plugin framework is now included in the mainline GCC. We developed machine learning plugins based on probabilistic and transductive approaches to predict good combinations of optimizations. Our preliminary experimental results show that it is possible to automatically reduce the execution time of individual MiBench programs, some by more than a factor of 2, while also improving compilation time and code size. On average we are able to reduce the execution time of the MiBench benchmark suite by 11% for the ARC reconfigurable processor. We also present a realistic multi-objective optimization scenario for Berkeley DB library using Milepost GCC and improve execution time by approximately 17%, while reducing compilation time and code size by 12% and 7% respectively on Intel Xeon processor."

                "text": "Program autotuning has been shown to achieve better or more portable performance in a number of domains. However, autotuners themselves are rarely portable between projects, for a number of reasons: using a domain-informed search space representation is critical to achieving good results; search spaces can be intractably large and require advanced machine learning techniques; and the landscape of search spaces can vary greatly between different problems, sometimes requiring domain specific search techniques to explore efficiently. This paper introduces OpenTuner, a new open source framework for building domain-specific multi-objective program autotuners. OpenTuner supports fully-customizable configuration representations, an extensible technique representation to allow for domain-specific techniques, and an easy to use interface for communicating with the program to be autotuned. A key capability inside OpenTuner is the use of ensembles of disparate search techniques simultaneously; techniques that perform well will dynamically be allocated a larger proportion of tests. We demonstrate the efficacy and generality of OpenTuner by building autotuners for 7 distinct projects and 16 total benchmarks, showing speedups over prior techniques of these projects of up to 2.8\u03c7 with little programmer effort."

This paper develops a new methodology to reduce this number and hence speed up iterative optimization. It uses predictive modelling from the domain of machine learning to automatically focus search on those areas likely to give greatest performance. This approach is independent of search algorithm, search space or compiler infrastructure and scales gracefully with the compiler optimization space size. Off-line, a training set of programs is iteratively evaluated and the shape of the spaces and program features are modelled. These models are learnt and used to focus the iterative optimization of a new program. We evaluate two learnt models, an independent and Markov model, and evaluate their worth on two embedded platforms, the Texas Instrument C67I3 and the AMD Au1500. We show that such learnt models can speed up iterative search on large spaces by an order of magnitude. This translates into an average speedup of 1.22 on the TI C6713 and 1.27 on the AMD Au1500 in just 2 evaluations."

Finding a heuristic that performs well on a broad range of applications is a tedious and difficult process. This paper introduces Meta Optimization, a methodology for automatically fine-tuning compiler heuristics. Meta Optimization uses machine-learning techniques to automatically search the space of compiler heuristics. Our techniques reduce compiler design complexity by relieving compiler writers of the tedium of heuristic tuning. Our machine-learning system uses an evolutionary algorithm to automatically find effective compiler heuristics. We present promising experimental results. In one mode of operation Meta Optimization creates application-specific heuristics which often result in impressive speedups. For hyperblock formation, one optimization we present in this paper, we obtain an average speedup of 23% (up to 73%) for the applications in our suite. Furthermore, by evolving a compiler's heuristic over several benchmarks, we can create effective, general-purpose heuristics. The best general-purpose heuristic our system found for hyperblock formation improved performance by an average of 25% on our training set, and 9% on a completely unrelated test set. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques on three different optimizations in this paper: hyperblock formation, register allocation, and data prefetching."

One promising research direction to overcome this problem is the development of dynamic, feedback-directed optimization orchestration algorithms, which automatically search for the combination of optimization techniques that achieves the best program performance. The challenge is to develop an orchestration algorithm that finds, in an exponential search space, a solution that is close to the best, in acceptable time. In this paper, we build such a fast and effective algorithm, called combined elimination (CE). The key advance of CE over existing techniques is that it takes the least tuning time (57% of the closest alternative), while achieving the same program performance. We conduct the experiments on both a Pentium IV machine and a SPARC II machine, by measuring performance of SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks under a large set of 38 GCC compiler options. Furthermore, through orchestrating a small set of optimizations causing the most degradation, we show that the performance achieved by CE is close to the upper bound obtained by an exhaustive search algorithm. The gap is less than 0.2% on average."

Since code transformations may often degrade performance or interfere with subsequent transformations, compilers employ predictive heuristics to guide optimizations by predicting their effects a priori. Unfortunately, the unpredictability of optimization interaction and the irregularity of today's wide-issue machines severely limit the accuracy of these heuristics. As a result, compiler writers may temper high variance optimizations with overly conservative heuristics or may exclude these optimizations entirely. While this process results in a compiler capable of generating good average code quality across the target benchmark set, it is at the cost of missed optimization opportunities in individual code segments. To replace predictive heuristics, researchers have proposed compilers which explore many optimization options, selecting the best one a posteriori. Unfortunately, these existing iterative compilation techniques are not practical for reasons of compile time and applicability. We present the Optimization-Space Exploration (OSE) compiler organization, the first practical iterative compilation strategy applicable to optimizations in general-purpose compilers. Instead of replacing predictive heuristics, OSE uses the compiler writer's knowledge encoded in the heuristics to select a small number of promising optimization alternatives for a given code segment. Compile time is limited by evaluating only these alternatives for hot code segments using a general compile-time performance estimator An OSE-enhanced version of Intel's highly-tuned, aggressively optimizing production compiler for IA-64 yields a significant performance improvement, more than 20% in some cases, on Itanium for SPEC codes."

Current RL libraries offer parallelism at the level of the entire program, coupling all the components together and making existing implementations difficult to extend, combine, and reuse. We argue for building composable RL components by encapsulating parallelism and resource requirements within individual components, which can be achieved by building on top of a flexible task-based programming model. We demonstrate this principle by building Ray RLLib on top of Ray and show that we can implement a wide range of state-of-the-art algorithms by composing and reusing a handful of standard components. This composability does not come at the cost of performance --- in our experiments, RLLib matches or exceeds the performance of highly optimized reference implementations. Ray RLLib is available as part of Ray at this https URL"

                "text": "Most modern compilers operate by applying a fixed, program-independent sequence of optimizations to all programs. Compiler writers choose a single \"compilation sequence\", or perhaps a couple of compilation sequences. In choosing a sequence, they may consider performance of benchmarks or other important codes. These sequences are intended as general-purpose tools, accessible through command-line flags such as -O2 and -O3.Specific compilation sequences make a significant difference in the quality of the generated code, whether compiling for speed, for space, or for other metrics. A single universal compilation sequence does not produce the best results over all programs [8, 10, 29, 32]. Finding an optimal program-specific compilation sequence is difficult because the space of potential sequences is huge and the interactions between optimizations are poorly understood. Moreover, there is no systematic exploration of the costs and benefits of searching for good (i.e., within a certain percentage of optimal) program-specific compilation sequences.In this paper, we perform a large experimental study of the space of compilation sequences over a set of known benchmarks, using our prototype adaptive compiler. Our goal is to characterize these spaces and to determine if it is cost-effective to construct custom compilation sequences. We report on five exhaustive enumerations which demonstrate that 80% of the local minima in the space are within 5 to 10% of the optimal solution. We describe three algorithms tailored to search such spaces and report on experiments that use these algorithms to find good compilation sequences. These experiments suggest that properties observed in the enumerations hold for larger search spaces and larger programs. Our findings indicate that for the cost of 200 to 4,550 compilations, we can find custom sequences that are 15 to 25% better than the human-designed fixed-sequence originally used in our compiler."

LLVM defines a common, low-level code representation in static single assignment (SSA) form, with several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs. To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural problems; and (c) illustrative examples of the benefits LLVM provides for several challenging compiler problems."

Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari show that ES is a viable solution strategy that scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available: By using a novel communication strategy based on common random numbers, our ES implementation only needs to communicate scalars, making it possible to scale to over a thousand parallel workers. This allows us to solve 3D humanoid walking in 10 minutes and obtain competitive results on most Atari games after one hour of training. In addition, we highlight several advantages of ES as a black box optimization technique: it is invariant to action frequency and delayed rewards, tolerant of extremely long horizons, and does not need temporal discounting or value function approximation."

Using an HLS tool implemented within the state-of-the-art LLVM compiler, we study the effect of compiler optimizations on the hardware metrics of circuit area, execution cycles, FMax, and wall-clock time. We evaluate 56 different compiler optimizations implemented within LLVM and show that some optimizations significantly affect hardware quality. Moreover, we show that hardware quality is also affected by some optimization parameter values, as well as the order in which optimizations are applied. We then present a new HLS-directed approach to compiler optimizations, wherein we execute partial HLS and profiling at intermittent points in the optimization process and use the results to judiciously undo the impact of optimization passes predicted to be damaging to the generated hardware quality. Results show that our approach produces circuits with 16% better speed performance, on average, versus using the standard -O3 optimization level."

These problems with delayed and often sequentially aggregated reward, are often inherently reinforcement learning problems and present the opportunity to leverage the recent substantial advances in deep reinforcement learning. However, in some cases, it is not clear why deep reinforcement learning is a good fit for the problem. Sometimes, it does not perform better than the state-of-the-art solutions. And in other cases, random search or greedy algorithms could outperform deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we review, discuss, and evaluate the recent trends of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. We propose a set of essential metrics to guide future works in evaluating the efficacy of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. Our evaluation includes challenges, the types of problems, their formulation in the deep reinforcement learning setting, embedding, the model used, efficiency, and robustness. We conclude with a discussion on open challenges and potential directions for pushing further the integration of reinforcement learning in system optimization."

Using a HLS tool implemented within the state-of-the-art LLVM [1] compiler, we study the effect of compiler optimizations on the hardware metrics of circuit area, execution cycles, Fmax, and wall-clock time. We evaluate 56 different compiler optimizations implemented within LLVM and show that some optimizations significantly affect hardware quality. Moreover, we show that hardware quality is also affected by the order in which optimizations are applied. We then present a new HLS-directed approach to compiler optimizations, wherein we execute partial HLS and profiling at intermittent points in the optimization process and use the results to judiciously undo the impact of optimization passes predicted to be damaging to the generated hardware quality. Results show that our approach produces circuits with 16% better speed performance, on average, versus using the standard -O3 optimization level."

To improve the quality of C compilers, we created Csmith, a randomized test-case generation tool, and spent three years using it to find compiler bugs. During this period we reported more than 325 previously unknown bugs to compiler developers. Every compiler we tested was found to crash and also to silently generate wrong code when presented with valid input. In this paper we present our compiler-testing tool and the results of our bug-hunting study. Our first contribution is to advance the state of the art in compiler testing. Unlike previous tools, Csmith generates programs that cover a large subset of C while avoiding the undefined and unspecified behaviors that would destroy its ability to automatically find wrong-code bugs. Our second contribution is a collection of qualitative and quantitative results about the bugs we have found in open-source C compilers."

                "text": "Evolution strategies (ES) are a family of black-box optimization algorithms able to train deep neural networks roughly as well as Q-learning and policy gradient methods on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems, but are much faster (e.g. hours vs. days) because they parallelize better. However, many RL problems require directed exploration because they have reward functions that are sparse or deceptive (i.e. contain local optima), and it is unknown how to encourage such exploration with ES. Here we show that algorithms that have been invented to promote directed exploration in small-scale evolved neural networks via populations of exploring agents, specifically novelty search (NS) and quality diversity (QD) algorithms, can be hybridized with ES to improve its performance on sparse or deceptive deep RL tasks, while retaining scalability. Our experiments confirm that the resultant new algorithms, NS-ES and two QD algorithms, NSR-ES and NSRA-ES, avoid local optima encountered by ES to achieve higher performance on Atari and simulated robots learning to walk around a deceptive trap. This paper thus introduces a family of fast, scalable algorithms for reinforcement learning that are capable of directed exploration. It also adds this new family of exploration algorithms to the RL toolbox and raises the interesting possibility that analogous algorithms with multiple simultaneous paths of exploration might also combine well with existing RL algorithms outside ES."

These applications impose new and demanding systems requirements, both in terms of performance and flexibility. In this paper, we consider these requirements and present Ray---a distributed system to address them. Ray implements a dynamic task graph computation model that supports both the task-parallel and the actor programming models. To meet the performance requirements of AI applications, we propose an architecture that logically centralizes the system's control state using a sharded storage system and a novel bottom-up distributed scheduler. In our experiments, we demonstrate sub-millisecond remote task latencies and linear throughput scaling beyond 1.8 million tasks per second. We empirically validate that Ray speeds up challenging benchmarks and serves as both a natural and performant fit for an emerging class of reinforcement learning applications and algorithms."

This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem."

We demonstrate the benefits of this principle through RLlib: a library that provides scalable software primitives for RL.

Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time."

The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input."

Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word \"reinforcement.\" The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning."

However, the cost and difficulty of hardware design is often prohibitive, and consequently, a software approach is used for most applications. In this article, we introduce a new high-level synthesis tool called LegUp that allows software techniques to be used for hardware design. LegUp accepts a standard C program as input and automatically compiles the program to a hybrid architecture containing an FPGA-based MIPS soft processor and custom hardware accelerators that communicate through a standard bus interface. In the hybrid processor/accelerator architecture, program segments that are unsuitable for hardware implementation can execute in software on the processor. LegUp can synthesize most of the C language to hardware, including fixed-sized multidimensional arrays, structs, global variables, and pointer arithmetic. Results show that the tool produces hardware solutions of comparable quality to a commercial high-level synthesis tool. We also give results demonstrating the ability of the tool to explore the hardware/software codesign space by varying the amount of a program that runs in software versus hardware. LegUp, along with a set of benchmark C programs, is open source and freely downloadable, providing a powerful platform that can be leveraged for new research on a wide range of high-level synthesis topics."

In this paper we explore an alternative approach in which the policy is explicitly represented by its own function approximator, independent of the value function, and is updated according to the gradient of expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. Williams's REINFORCE method and actor-critic methods are examples of this approach. Our main new result is to show that the gradient can be written in a form suitable for estimation from experience aided by an approximate action-value or advantage function. Using this result, we prove for the first time that a version of policy iteration with arbitrary differentiable function approximation is convergent to a locally optimal policy."

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\u2013156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression."

As researchers have learned about the technique, they have derived new versions, developed new applications, and published theoretical studies of the effects of the various parameters and aspects of the algorithm. This paper comprises a snapshot of particle swarming from the authors\u2019 perspective, including variations in the algorithm, current and ongoing research, applications and open problems.\n"
