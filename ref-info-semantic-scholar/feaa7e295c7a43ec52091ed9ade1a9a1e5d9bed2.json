                "text": "Bayesian treatments of learning in neural networks are typically based either on local Gaussian approximations to a mode of the posterior weight distribution, or on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. A third approach, called ensemble learning, was introduced by Hinton and van Camp (1993). It aims to approximate the posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and a parametric approximating distribution. However, the derivation of a deterministic algorithm relied on the use of a Gaussian approximating distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix and so was unable to capture the posterior correlations between parameters. In this paper, we show how the ensemble learning approach can be extended to full-covariance Gaussian distributions while remaining computationally tractable. We also extend the framework to deal with hyperparameters, leading to a simple re-estimation procedure. Initial results from a standard benchmark problem are encouraging."

This book demonstrates how Bayesian methods allow complex neural network models to be used without fear of the \"overfitting\" that can occur with traditional training methods. Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence."

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets."

So during learning, it is important to keep the weights simple by penalizing the amount of information they contain. The amount of information in a weight can be controlled by adding Gaussian noise and the noise level can be adapted during learning to optimize the trade-o between the expected squared error of the network and the amount of information in the weights. We describe a method of computing the derivatives of the expected squared error and of the amount of information in the noisy weights in a network that contains a layer of non-linear hidden units. Provided the output units are linear, the exact derivatives can be computed e ciently without time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. The idea of minimizing the amount of information that is required to communicate the weights of a neural network leads to a number of interesting schemes for encoding the weights."

This method, \"Expectation Propagation,\" unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and varitmce, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be donvincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers."

                "text": "Recent experimental studies indicate that synaptic changes induced by neuronal activity are discrete jumps between a small number of stable states. Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a computationally hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning algorithm that derives from belief propagation algorithms. We show that it performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite number of \u201chidden\u201d states per synapse, that has to learn a random classification task. Such a system is able to learn a number of associations close to the theoretical limit in time that is sublinear in system size. This is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse. Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden states that becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to the standard \u201cperceptron\u201d learning algorithm, with an additional rule for synaptic transitions that occur only if a currently presented pattern is \u201cbarely correct.\u201d In this case, the synaptic changes are metaplastic only (change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the synapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible states and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K visible states. We suggest that this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily implemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

A neural model with each weight limited to a small integer range will require little surface of silicon. Moreover, according to Occam's razor principle, better generalization abilities can be expected from a simpler computational model. The price to pay for these benefits lies in the difficulty to train these kind of networks. This paper proposes essentially two new ideas for constructive training algorithms, and demonstrates their efficiency for the generation of feedforward networks composed of Boolean threshold gates with discrete weights. A proof of the convergence of these algorithms is given. Some numerical experiments have been carried out and the results are presented in terms of the size of the generated networks and of their generalization abilities."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

We describe a pre-trained deep neural network hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid architecture that trains the DNN to produce a distribution over senones (tied triphone states) as its output. The deep belief network pre-training algorithm is a robust and often helpful way to initialize deep neural networks generatively that can aid in optimization and reduce generalization error. We illustrate the key components of our model, describe the procedure for applying CD-DNN-HMMs to LVSR, and analyze the effects of various modeling choices on performance. Experiments on a challenging business search dataset demonstrate that CD-DNN-HMMs can significantly outperform the conventional context-dependent Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-HMMs, with an absolute sentence accuracy improvement of 5.8% and 9.2% (or relative error reduction of 16.0% and 23.2%) over the CD-GMM-HMMs trained using the minimum phone error rate (MPE) and maximum-likelihood (ML) criteria, respectively."

Many scientists, engineers and other practitioners are now using neural networks to tackle problems that are either intractable or unrealistically time consuming to solve through traditional computational strategies. The inaugural volume in the Computational Intelligence Library provides speeedy dissemination of new ideas to a broad spectrum of neural network users, designers and implementers. Devoted to network fundamentals, models, algorithms and applications, the work is intended to become the standard reference resource for the neural network community. As the field expands and develops, leading researchers will report on an analyze promising new approaches. In this way, the Handbook will become an evolving compendium on the state of the art of neural computation. Available in loose-leaf print form as well as in an electronic edition that combines both CD-ROM and on-line (World Wide Web) access to its contents, the Handbook of Neural Computation is available on a subscription basis, with regularly publishedsupplements keeping readers abreast of late-breaking developments and new advances in this rapidly developing field."

An alternative way to evaluate the fit is to use a feed-forward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients as input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks (DNNs) that have many hidden layers and are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform GMMs on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This article provides an overview of this progress and represents the shared views of four research groups that have had recent successes in using DNNs for acoustic modeling in speech recognition."

We derive mistake bounds for the binary and multiclass settings that are similar in form to the second order perceptron bound. Our bounds do not assume separability.

However, most standard neural network models are not very suitable for implementation in hardware and adaptations are needed. In this section an overview is given of the various issues that are encountered when mapping an ideal neural network model onto a compact and reliable neural network hardware implementation, like quantization, handling nonuniformities and nonideal responses, and restraining computational complexity. Furthermore, a broad range of hardware-friendly learning rules is presented, which allow for simpler and more reliable hardware implementations. The relevance of these neural network adaptations to hardware is illustrated by their application in existing hardware implementations."

An iterative optimization process based on a \"modified local search\" component is complemented with a meta-strategy to realize a discrete dynamical system that discourages limit cycles and the confinement of the search trajectory in a limited portion of the search space. The possible cycles are discouraged by prohibiting (i.e., making tabu) the execution of moves that reverse the ones applied in the most recent part of the search. The prohibition period is adapted in an automated way. The confinement is avoided and a proper exploration is obtained by activating a diversification strategy when too many configurations are repeated excessively often. The RTS method is applicable to nondifferentiable functions, is robust with respect to the random initialization, and effective in continuing the search after local minima. Three tests of the technique on feedforward and feedback systems are presented."

Chapter 3 focuses on selection of two-level factorial designs and discusses complementary design theory and related topics in the selection of designs. Chapter 4 covers the selection of three level designs followed by the general case of s-levels. Chapter 5 discusses estimation capacity, presenting the connections with complementary designs followed by the estimation capacity for two-level and s-level designs. Chapter 6 discusses and presents results for the construction of mixed-level designs. Giving many examples of the use of mixed two and four-level designs. The final unit of the book discusses designs where there are two-different groups of factors. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss factorial designs with restricted randomization. Focusing first on blocked designs for full factorials as well as blocked fractional factorial designs. Chapter 8 focuses on split-plot designs. The booked is concluded with a chapter on robust parameter designs. This book covers a broad range of topics for regular factorial designs and presents all of the material in very mathematical fashion. However, the authors do a wonderful job of keeping the statistical methodology at the forefront of the book and the mathematical detail is presented as the necessary tool to study these designs. The book will serve as a great text for an advanced graduate level course in design theory for students with the necessary mathematical background. The book will surely become an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students doing research in the design of factorial experiments. In addition, practitioners will also find the book useful for the comprehensive collection of optimal designs presented at the end of many chapters. Overall, this is a very well written book and a necessary addition to the existing literature on the design of factorial experiments."

An important goal in understanding this phenomenon is to infer a 'splicing code' that predicts how splicing is regulated in different cell types by features derived from RNA, DNA and epigenetic modifiers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe formulate the assembly of a splicing code as a problem of statistical inference and introduce a Bayesian method that uses an adaptively selected number of hidden variables to combine subgroups of features into a network, allows different tissues to share feature subgroups and uses a Gibbs sampler to hedge predictions and ascertain the statistical significance of identified features.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing data for 3665 cassette exons, 1014 RNA features and 4 tissue types derived from 27 mouse tissues (http://genes.toronto.edu/wasp), we benchmarked several methods. Our method outperforms all others, and achieves relative improvements of 52% in splicing code quality and up to 22% in classification error, compared with the state of the art. Novel combinations of regulatory features and novel combinations of tissues that share feature subgroups were identified using our method.\n\n\nCONTACT\nfrey@psi.toronto.edu\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
