This is a contribution to the growing body of work contrasting the representational power of deep and shallow network architectures. In particular, we offer a framework for comparing deep and shallow models that belong to the family of piecewise linear functions based on computational geometry. We look at a deep rectifier multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with linear outputs units and compare it with a single layer version of the model. In the asymptotic regime, when the number of inputs stays constant, if the shallow model has $kn$ hidden units and $n_0$ inputs, then the number of linear regions is $O(k^{n_0}n^{n_0})$. For a $k$ layer model with $n$ hidden units on each layer it is $\\Omega(\\left( {n}/{n_0}\\right)^{k-1}n^{n_0})$. $\\left({n}/{n_0}\\right)^{k-1}$ grows faster then $k^{n_0}$ when either $n$ goes to infinity or $k$ goes to infinity and $n > 2n_0$. We consider this as a first step towards understanding the complexity of these models and specifically towards providing suitable mathematical tools for future analysis."

This is a contribution to the growing body of work contrasting the representational power of deep and shallow network architectures. In particular, we offer a framework for comparing deep and shallow models that belong to the family of piecewise linear functions based on computational geometry. We look at a deep rectifier multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with linear outputs units and compare it with a single layer version of the model. In the asymptotic regime, when the number of inputs stays constant, if the shallow model has $kn$ hidden units and $n_0$ inputs, then the number of linear regions is $O(k^{n_0}n^{n_0})$. For a $k$ layer model with $n$ hidden units on each layer it is $\\Omega(\\left\\lfloor {n}/{n_0}\\right\\rfloor^{k-1}n^{n_0})$. The number $\\left\\lfloor{n}/{n_0}\\right\\rfloor^{k-1}$ grows faster than $k^{n_0}$ when $n$ tends to infinity or when $k$ tends to infinity and $n \\geq 2n_0$. Additionally, even when $k$ is small, if we restrict $n$ to be $2n_0$, we can show that a deep model has considerably more linear regions that a shallow one. We consider this as a first step towards understanding the complexity of these models and specifically towards providing suitable mathematical tools for future analysis."

We describe how one can use unlabeled data to improve the generalization error obtained by natural gradient and empirically evaluate the robustness of the algorithm to the ordering of the training set compared to stochastic gradient descent. Finally we extend natural gradient to incorporate second order information alongside the manifold information and provide a benchmark of the new algorithm using a truncated Newton approach for inverting the metric matrix instead of using a diagonal approximation of it."

In addition, Anthony and Bartlett develop a model of classification by real-output networks, and demonstrate the usefulness of classification with a \"large margin.\" The authors explain the role of scale-sensitive versions of the Vapnik Chervonenkis dimension in large margin classification, and in real prediction. Key chapters also discuss the computational complexity of neural network learning, describing a variety of hardness results, and outlining two efficient, constructive learning algorithms.

However, DBNs are frequently applied to model real-valued data, and so far little is known about their representational power in this case. We analyze the approximation properties of DBNs with two layers of binary hidden units and visible units with conditional distributions from the exponential family. It is shown that these DBNs can, under mild assumptions, model any additive mixture of distributions from the exponential family with independent variables. An arbitrarily good approximation in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence of an m-dimensional mixture distribution with n components can be achieved by a DBN with m visible variables and n and n + 1 hidden variables in the first and second hidden layer, respectively. Furthermore, relevant infinite mixtures can be approximated arbitrarily well by a DBN with a finite number of neurons. This includes the important special case of an infinite mixture of Gaussian distributions with fixed variance restricted to a compact domain, which in turn can approximate any strictly positive density over this domain."

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets."

                "text": "Most current speech recognition systems use hidden Markov models ( HMMs) to deal with the temporal variability of speech and Gaussian mixture models to determine how well each state of each HMM fits a frame or a short window of frames of coefficients that represents the acoustic input. An alternati ve way to evaluate the fit is to use a feedforward neural network that takes several frames of coefficients a s input and produces posterior probabilities over HMM states as output. Deep neural networks with many hidden layers, that are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform Gaussian mixture models on a variety of speech rec ognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin. This paper provides an overview of this progress and repres nts the shared views of four research groups who have had recent successes in using deep neural networks for a coustic modeling in speech recognition."

These can be generalized by replacing each binary unit by an infinite number of copies that all have the same weights but have progressively more negative biases. The learning and inference rules for these \"Stepped Sigmoid Units\" are unchanged. They can be approximated efficiently by noisy, rectified linear units. Compared with binary units, these units learn features that are better for object recognition on the NORB dataset and face verification on the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset. Unlike binary units, rectified linear units preserve information about relative intensities as information travels through multiple layers of feature detectors."
