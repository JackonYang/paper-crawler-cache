This study addresses the question of how simple networks of neuron-like elements can account for a variety of phenomena associated with this shift of selective visual attention. Specifically, we propose the following: (1) A number of elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of movement, disparity etc. are represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called the early representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping from the early topographic representation into a more central non-topographic representation, such that at any instant the central representation contains the properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the selected location. We suggest that this mapping is the principal expression of early selective visual attention. One function of selective attention is to fuse information from different maps into one coherent whole. (3) Certain selection rules determine which locations will be mapped into the central representation. The major rule, using the conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network. Inhibiting the selected location in this network causes an automatic shift towards the next most conspicious location. Additional rules are proximity and similarity preferences. We discuss how these rules can be implemented in neuron-like networks and suggest a possible role for the extensive back-projection from the visual cortex to the LGN."

The mechanism in the pulvinar is assumed to be a particular type of circuit that reciprocally connects thalamic relay cells to cortical cells. This circuit, which is characteristic of thalamic nuclei in general, appears to embody an algorithm that enhances firing in a target set of cells while inhibiting firing in the surrounding set of cells. Recent PET studies have also identified specific areas of cortex that show increased blood flow when humans expect to process particular aspects of visual objects, such as location, shape, color, and movement velocity. An expectation for a particular feature can be regarded as a peaked activity distribution across cortical synaptic space that increases the effectiveness (accuracy and speed) of the perception of that feature and features similar to that feature. The expectation process is assumed to be generated by a thalamic enhancement circuit, which in turn is driven by a cognitive procedure, apparently located in the anterior cingulate area of the cortex. The selection of a particular cognitive procedure is assumed to depend on the momentary relative motivational value associated with it by means of connections to deeper limbic structures. Under usual conditions, the procedure having the dominant motivational value is the one selected."

Researchers have long argued that such a mechanism is necessary to efficiently perform many intermediate level visual tasks. This paper describes VISIT, a novel neural network model of visual attention. The current system models the search for target objects in scenes containing multiple distractors. This is a natural task for people, it is studied extensively by psychologists, and it requires attention. The network's behavior closely matches the known psychophysical data on visual search and visual attention. VISIT also matches much of the physiological data on attention and provides a novel view of the functionality of a number of visual areas. This paper concentrates on the biological plausibility of the model and its relationship to the primary visual cortex, pulvinar, superior colliculus and posterior parietal areas."

This strategy can be used for resolving computational problems arising in the domains of stereopsis, directed visual attention, and the perception of moving images. In each of these situations, some means of dynamically controlling how retinal outputs map onto higher-level targets is desirable--in order to achieve binocular fusion, to allow shifts of the focus of attention, and to prevent blurring of moving images. The proposed solution involves what we term \"shifter circuits,\" which allow for dynamic shifts in the relative alignment of input and output arrays without loss of local spatial relationships. The shifts are produced in increments along a succession of relay stages that are linked by diverging excitatory inputs. The direction of shift is controlled at each stage by inhibitory neurons that selectively suppress appropriate sets of ascending inputs. The shifter hypothesis is consistent with available anatomical and physiological evidence on the organization of the primate visual pathway, and it offers a sensible explanation for a variety of otherwise puzzling facts, such as the plethora of cells in the geniculorecipient layers of V1."

                "text": "In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment."

Starting with the known general structure of the thalamic circuit, we considered three variations of the projections from the inhibitory cells of the reticular nucleus onto the cells of the pulvinar nucleus of the dorsal thalamus. The three circuits were modeled as systems of difference equations, and their operations were simulated by computer-based numerical integration. In all three circuits, when input from a target location was slightly larger than the input from neighboring locations, the time evolution of principal (relay) cell outputs showed substantial selective enhancement at the target location compared with neighboring locations. The selective enhancement effect was produced not only on ascending inputs but also on descending cortical inputs. Simulations separating the lateral inhibitory and feedback-enhancement components of the circuits suggested that the feedback-enhancement component substantially magnified the ability of lateral inhibition to produce a target/surround difference."

It is now clear that the retina and visual pathways do not simply transmit a mosaic of Iight and dark to some central sensorium. Rather, even at the retinal level, specific features of visual stimuli are detected and their presence communicated to the next level. In cats and monkeys, the geniculostriate visual system consists of a series of converging and diverging connections such that at each successive tier of processing mechanism, single neurons respond to increasingly more specific visual stimuli falling on an increasingly wider area of the retina (19-Z). How far does this analytical-synthetic process continue whereby individual cells have more and more specific trigger features? Are there regions of the brain beyond striate and prestriatel cortex where this processing of visual information is carrie,d further? If so, how far and in what way? Are there cells that are concerned with the storage of visual information as well as its analysis? There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a possible site for further processing of visual information and perhaps even for storage of such information might, in the monkey, be inferotemporal cortexthe cortex on the inferior convexity of the temporal lobe. First, this area receives afferents from prestriate cortex which itself processes visual information received from"

In this paper, I put forward a hypothesis on the role of the reciprocal, topographic pathways between two cortical areas, one often a 'higher' area dealing with more abstract information about the world, the other 'lower', dealing with more concrete data. The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows, sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A third part of this paper will deal with extensions of these ideas to the frontal lobe."

                "text": "We have examined the properties of neurons in three subdivisions of the pulvinar of alert, trained rhesus monkeys 1) an inferior, retinotopically mapped area (PI), 2) a lateral, retinotopically organized region (PL), and 3) a dorsomedial visual portion of the lateral pulvinar (Pdm), which has a crude retinotopic organization. We tested the neurons for visual responses to stationary and moving stimuli and for changes in these responses produced by behavioral manipulations. All areas contain cells sensitive to stimulus orientation as well as neurons selective for the direction of stimulus movement; however, the majority of cells in all three regions are either broadly tuned or nonselective for these attributes. Nearly all cells respond to stimulus onset, a significant number also give a response to stimulus termination, and rarely a cell gives only off responses. Nearly all cells increase their discharge rate to visual stimuli. Receptive fields in the two retinotopically mapped regions, PI and PL, have well-defined borders. The sizes of these receptive fields show a positive correlation with the eccentricity of the receptive fields. The receptive fields in the remaining region, Pdm, are frequently very large, but with these large fields excluded, show a similar correlation with eccentricity. All pulvinar cells tested (n = 20) were mapped in retinal coordinates; the receptive fields are positioned in relation to the retina. We found no cells with gaze-gated characteristics (2), nor cells mapped in a spatial coordinate system. The response latencies in PI and PL are shorter and less variable than the latencies in Pdm. Active use of a stimulus can produce an enhancement or attenuation of the visual response. Eye-movement modulation was found in all three subdivisions in about equal frequencies. Attentional modulation was common in Pdm and was rare in PI and PL. The modulation is spatially selective in Pdm and nonselective in PI for a small number of tested cells. These data demonstrate functional differences between Pdm and the other two areas and suggest that Pdm plays a role in selective visual attention, whereas PI and PL probably contribute to other aspects of visual perception."

In particular, it has been suggested that the orientation and direction selectivity of cells in the visual cortex result from the action of a nonlinear 'shunting' inhibition that emulates an AND\u0096NOT logical operation4. The characteristic biophysical feature of this proposed inhibitory mechanism is that it evokes a large and relatively sustained increase in the conductance of the neuronal membrane while leaving the membrane potential unaffected. This shunting mechanism contrasts with linear 'summative' inhibition in which conductance changes are less prominent, and inhibition is achieved by hyperpolarization of the membrane potential1. In a direct experimental test of the hypothesis that the selectivity of visual cortical neurons depends on shunting inhibition we found no evidence for the large conductance changes predicted by the theory."

Yet even for vision we still know very little about central mechanisms, about what happens after retinal impulses reach the striate cortex. The discovery some years ago that there is a visual area in the temporal lobe (Chow, 1951; Mishkin, 1954) opened up this black box a little. At least it made it clear that vision does not begin and end in the striate cortex as Lashley (1948) believed he had demonstrated. But what role the inferior temporal cortex plays in vision, and how it plays this role, have proved to be extremely baffling questions. I should like here to pursue these questions by bringing together some new evidence on the nature of the visual functions of the inferior temporal cortex and of the neural mechanisms on which these functions depend. My goal will be to develop a scheme for the way in which the cortical visual areas \u2014 the striate, the prestriate, and the inferotemporal \u2014 might interact to form a single, extended, cortical visual system. To begin, I shall describe some experiments I did in collaboration with Eiichi Iwai (Iwai and Mishkin, 1968), who was in our laboratory recently as a visiting scientist from Fukushima Medical College, Japan."

Previous theoretical (Feldman and Ballard 1982; Durbin and Rumelhart 1989; Mel 1990; Mel and Koch 1990; Poggio and Girosi 1990) and compartmental modeling (Koch et al. 1983; Shepherd et al. 1985; Koch and Poggio 1987; Rall and Segev 1987; Shepherd and Brayton 1987; Shepherd et al. 1989; Brown et al. 1991) work had suggested that multiplicative interactions among groups of neighboring synapses could greatly enhance the processing power of a neuron relative to a unit with only a single global firing threshold. This issue was investigated here, with a particular focus on the role of voltage-dependent N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) channels in the generation of cell responses. First, it was found that when a large proportion of the excitatory synaptic input to dendritic spines is carried by NMDA channels, the pyramidal cell responds preferentially to spatially clustered, rather than random, distributions of activated synapses. Second, based on this mechanism, the NMDA-rich neuron is shown to be capable of solving a nonlinear pattern discrimination task. We propose that manipulation of the spatial ordering of afferent synaptic connections onto the dendritic arbor is a possible biological strategy for pattern information storage during learning."

                "text": "that area 7 of posterior parietal cortex plays a role in visual attention and eye movements. We have operationally defined attention as a stimulus-selection process independent of the specific movement used to respond to the stimulus. We trained monkeys to make various hand or eye movements and recorded from single neurons in area 7 while the monkeys were performing these tasks. 2. As demonstrated previously ( 19, 20, 46, 47, 63), many cells in area 7 respond to visual stimuli independent of any behavior. The discharge to a stimulus may be enhanced when the animal makes an eye movement to the stimulus. 3. We used two paradigms to study the modulation of visual responses when the animal used a stimulus without making an eye movement. The first was a peripheral-attention task in which the animal had to signal the occurrence of a peripheral stimulus without making an eye movement to it. Half of the cells studied gave an enhanced response in this task. In the second task, the animal had to reach out and touch a stimulus without making an eye movement to it. Visually responsive parietal neurons also yielded enhanced responses in this task. 4. The enhancements demonstrable in the saccade, peripheral-attention, and handreach tasks probably represent the same underlying process because their frequency of occurrence in our sample is almost identical, the intensities are quite similar, and cells that give an enhanced response on one task give an enhanced response in the others. 5. These results show that in posterior parietal cortex, the behavioral enhancement of a visual response is independent of the specific movement used to respond to the stimulus. The physiological mechanism of enhancement, which is movement independent and spatially selective, resembles the psychological phenomenon of selective spatial attention. We suggest that the role of area 7 in visual attention may be mediated by the enhancement of visual responses to selected stimuli."

                "text": "Area V4, a visuotopically organized area in prestriate cortex of the macaque, is the major source of visual input to the inferior temporal cortex, known to be crucial for object recognition. To examine the selectivity of cells in V4 for stimulus form, we quantitatively measured the responses of 322 cells to bars varying in length, width, orientation, and polarity of contrast, and sinusoidal gratings varying in spatial frequency, phase, orientation, and overall size. All of the cells recorded in V4 were located on the lower portion of the prelunate gyrus. Receptive fields were located almost exclusively within the representation of the central 5 degrees of the lower visual field, and receptive field size, in linear dimension, was 4-7 times greater than that in the corresponding representation of striate cortex (V1). Nearly all receptive fields consisted of overlapping dark and light zones, like \"classic\" complex fields in V1, but the relative strengths of the dark and light zones often differed. A few cells responded exclusively to light or dark stimuli. Many cells in V4 were selective for stimulus orientation, and a few were selective for direction of motion as well. Although the median orientation bandwidth of the orientation-selective cells (52 degrees) was wider than that reported for oriented cells in V1, approximately 8% of the oriented cells had bandwidths of less than 30 degrees, which is nearly as narrow as the most narrowly tuned cells in V1. The proportion of cells selective for direction of motion (13%) was not markedly different from that reported in V1. The large majority of V4 cells were tuned to the length and width of bars, and the \"shape\" of the optimal bar varied from cell to cell, as has been reported for cells in the dorsolateral visual area (DL) of the owl monkey, a possible homologue of V4 in the macaque. Preferred lengths and widths varied independently from approximately 0.05 to 6 degrees, with the smallest preferred bars about the size of the smallest receptive fields in V1 and the largest preferred bars larger than any fields in V1. The relationship between the size of the optimal bar and the size of the receptive field varied from cell to cell. Some cells, for example, responded best to bars much narrower or shorter than the field, whereas other cells responded best to bars that filled (but did not extend beyond) the excitatory field in the length, width, or both dimensions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

In the present study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do not appear to be \u201cdetectors\u201d for complex objects, we did find a separate population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of faces in IT cortex."

Higher order neurones in the visual pathway are presumably more concerned with relative changes in illumination, that is, contrast, because a great deal of information concerning absolute light level is processed at the retinal level3. It would therefore be of considerable functional value if cells in the visual cortex could adapt their response levels to a steady-state ambient contrast, in a manner analogous to the sensitivity control mechanism of the retina. We have examined here the idea that adaptation of neurones in the visual cortex to ambient contrast is similar to adaptation in the retina to ambient illumination. The experiments were performed by measuring contrast response functions (response amplitude as a function of contrast) of striate neurones, while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels. Our results show that, for the majority of cortical neurones, response\u2013contrast curves are laterally shifted along a log-contrast axis so that the effective domains of neurones are adjusted to match prevailing contrast levels. This contrast gain control mechanism, which was not observed for lateral geniculate (LGN) fibres, must be of prime importance to visual function."

USA 81, 4586-4590]. We measured covert shifts of visual attention in three patients with unilateral thalamic hemorrhages shortly after the lesion and after a 6-month recovery period. The experiment measured reaction time to targets that occurred at locations to which attention had been cued (valid trials) or at a currently unattended location (invalid trials). Although the patients showed no deficits in visual fields with perimetry and no neglect in the 6-month follow-up, we found slow reaction times for targets on the side contralateral to the lesion whether or not attention had been cued to that location. Deficits have also been found in this task with cortical and midbrain lesions, but the patterns of performance are quite different. The results with thalamic patients suggest they have a specific deficit in the ability to use attention to improve the efficiency of processing visual targets contralateral to the lesion (engage operation). This finding is in accord with hypotheses of a thalamic link between cortical visual attention and pattern recognition systems proposed by Crick."

This paper describes a connectionist network that exhibits a variety of attentional phenomena reported by Treisman, Wolford, Duncan, and others. As demonstrated in several simulations, a hierarchical, multiscale network that uses feature arrays with strong lateral inhibitory connections provides responses in agreement with a number of prominent behaviors associated with visual attention. The overall network design is consistent with a range of data reported in the psychological literature, and with neurophysiol-ogical characteristics of primate vision."

The concluding chapter describes an autonomous system that builds from experience an internal model of the world and bases its operation on that internal model. Close attention is paid to the engineering of the memory, including comparisons to ordinary computer memories. \nSparse Distributed Memory provides an overall perspective on neural systems. The model it describes can aid in understanding human memory and learning, and a system based on it sheds light on outstanding problems in philosophy and artificial intelligence. Applications of the memory are expected to be found in the creation of adaptive systems for signal processing, speech, vision, motor control, and (in general) robots. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of the memory, in its implications for research in neural networks, is that its realization with neuronlike components resembles the cortex of the cerebellum. \nPentti Kanerva is a scientist at the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science at the NASA Ames Research Center and a visiting scholar at the Stanford Center for the Study of Language and Information.

We examined the topography of pulvinar projections to these two cortical regions by placing multiple injections of different tracers (fluorescent dyes, horseradish peroxidase) in the inferotemporal and inferior parietal cortex of macaque monkeys. The patterns of label observed after injections in inferotemporal gyrus indicate that area TEO and the ventral part of area V4 receive a major input from the ventral part of the lateral pulvinar (PuLv) while area TE has strong connections with the caudal pole of the medial pulvinar (PuM) and only minor connections with PuLv. In contrast, injections in the caudal inferior parietal cortex demonstrate that area PGc, on the lateral surface of the inferior parietal gyrus, and area POa, in the ventral bank of intraparietal sulcus, receive strong projections from PuM and the adjacent fringe of the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (PuLd). Paired injections of two different tracers in the inferotemporal and inferior parietal cortex of the same hemisphere revealed a nearly complete segregation of the two populations of labeled neurons in the pulvinar, with only a small region of overlap in PuM, close to the PuM/PuLd border. These results demonstrate a clear separation of the thalamic afferents to the inferior parietal and inferotemporal cortex which parallels the separation of prestriate afferents to these two cortical territories (Morel & Bullier, 1990)."

Psychophysical evidence indicated that the sensitivity for discriminating subtle stimulus changes in a same-different matching task was higher when subjects selectively attended to one attribute than when they divided attention among the attributes. PET measurements of brain activity indicated that modulations of extrastriate visual activity were primarily produced by task conditions of selective attention. Attention to speed activated a region in the left inferior parietal lobule. Attention to color activated a region in the collateral sulcus and dorsolateral occipital cortex, while attention to shape activated collateral sulcus (similarly to color), fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, and temporal cortex along the superior temporal sulcus. Outside the visual system, selective and divided attention activated nonoverlapping sets of brain regions. Selective conditions activated globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, posterior thalamus/colliculus, and insular-premotor regions, while the divided condition activated the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results in the visual system demonstrate that selective attention to different features modulates activity in distinct regions of extrastriate cortex that appear to be specialized for processing the selected feature. The disjoint pattern of activations in extravisual brain regions during selective- and divided-attention conditions also suggests that preceptual judgements involve different neural systems, depending on attentional strategies."

This process involves many stages of analysis and a variety of information processing strategies. This paper concentrates on the importance of 'information bottlenecks,' which restrict the amount of information that can be handled at different stages of analysis. These steps are crucial for reducing the overwhelming computational complexity associated with recognizing countless objects from arbitrary viewing angles, distances, and perspectives. The process of directed visual attention is an especially important information bottleneck because of its flexibility in determining how information is routed to high-level pattern recognition centers."

Two experiments focused upon the following questions: (1) Can the spatial extent of the attentional focus be made to vary in response to precues? (2) As the area of the attentional focus increases, is there a decrease in processing efficiency for stimuli within the focus? (3) Is the boundary of the focus sharply demarked from the residual field, or does it show a gradual dropoff in processing resources? Subjects were required to search eight-letter circular displays for one of two target letters and reaction times were recorded. One to four adjacent display positions were precued by underlines at various stimulus onset asynchronies before display presentation. A response competition paradigm was used, in which the \u201cother target\u201d was used as a noise letter in noncued as well as cued locations. The results were in good agreement with the zoom lens model."

The responses of parietal LS neurons to visual stimuli are facilitated during the state of attentive fixation of a target light as compared to their responses to physically and retinotopically identical test stimuli delivered during the eye pauses of alert wakefulness. Seventy percent of the neurons tested (n = 55) showed significant increments in responses in the state of attentive fixation; the median value of the increments was 3.5 times. Only 4 of the 55 cells examined completely showed the reverse relation. Three sets of control experiments were done. The facilitation occurred when the responses evoked during the trials of a reaction task with attentive fixation of a target were compared with those evoked by identical stimuli delivered to the same retinotopic locations at the end of each intertrial interval: the facilitation of attentive fixation is not due to a shift in the general level of arousal. The facilitation occurred when the animal maintained attentive fixation of a spot of the tangent screen without a target light or when an additional light mimicking the target light was presented along with testing stimuli in the state of alert wakefulness without attentive fixation: the facilitation is not produced by a sensory-sensory interaction between target and testing lights. Finally, the facilitation was observed whether or not the test stimuli were behaviorally relevant. We conclude that the act of attentive fixation exerts a specific and powerful effect upon the excitability of the neural systems linking the retinae and the inferior parietal lobule and that the facilitation plays an important role in visually guided behavior."

The system is an application of the dynamic link architecture, which owes its strength to an enhancement of tradition neural networks by a new kind of variable to express the hierarchical grouping of neurons. This capability is used to group primitive local feature detectors (Gabor-based wavelets) into composite feature detectors (jets) and to preserve neighborhood relationships between jets when they lose position information on the way from the image domain to the object domain. Due to the potential for grouping, objects can be represented as attributed graphs, with jets serving as attributes. Recognition is formulated as graph matching and is implemented as a topologically constrained diffusion of image-object links. A hierarchical sequence of matches, from low-frequency components of jets to high-frequency components, is used. Size invariance is achieved by interposing diffusion steps in magnification space. The system is implemented on a network of transputers"

The time course of these changes suggests that mere lack of stimulation in the vicinity of the RF accompanied by stimulation in the surrounding region causes the RF expansion. While recording from single cells in cat area 17, we simulated this pattern of stimulation with a pattern of moving lines in the visual field, masking out an area covering the RF of the recorded cell, thereby producing an \"artificial scotoma.\" Over approximately 10 min this masking resulted in a 5-fold average expansion in RF area. Stimulating the RF center caused the field to collapse in size, returning to near its original extent; reconditioning with the masked stimulus led to RF reexpansion. Stimulation in the surrounding region was required for the RF expansion to occur--little expansion was seen during exposure to a blank screen. We propose that the expansion may account for visual illusions, such as perceptual fill-in of stabilized images and illusory contours and may constitute the prodrome of altered cortical topography after retinal lesions. These findings support the idea that even in adult animals RFs are dynamic, capable of being altered by the sensory context."

When a familiar object is in an unusual orientation, the deciding factor in the choice of the canonical object-based frame may be the fact that relative to this frame the object has a familiar shape description. This may suggest that we first hypothesise an object-based frame and then test the resultant shape description for familiarity. However, it is possible to organise the interactions between units in a parallel network so that the pattern of activity in the network simultaneously converges on a representation of the shape and a representation of the object-based frame of reference. The connections in the network are determined by the constraints inherent in the image formation process."

The data is presented separately for 13 sublaminae. For the total cortical thickness, the average numerical density of neurons is approxiametly 120,000 per mm3 of tissue. This density increases and decreases in the different sublaminae in the direction that one would expect from the classical descriptions of Nissl\u2010stained material (e.g., 137,000/mm3 in IVC\u03b1; 211,000/mm3 in IVC\u03b2). There are about 200,000 neurons under 1 mm2 of cortical surface: 28% are in layers I\u2010III, 45% are in layer IV, and 27% are in layers V and VI. The total number in area 17 of one hemisphere is close to 160,000,000. For the total cortical thickness the numerical density of synapses is 276,000,000 per mm3 of tissue. Laminae with higher neuronal densities tend to have higher synaptic densities but the correlation is not perfectly concordant. Moreover, the changes in synaptic densities are not as great as those in neurol densities so that laminae with higher neuronal densities have a lower synapse to neuron ratio and laminae with lower neuronal densities have a higher synapse to neuron ratio. For the total cortical thickness this ratio is 2,300 synapses per neuron (1,400 in layer IVC\u03b2 and 2,800 in layers II and III). There are 478 million synapses under 1 mm2 of cortical surface: 40% are in layers I\u2013III, 35% are in layer IV, and 25% are in layers V and VI. The numerical densities of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microcytes are 38,000, 17,000, and 4,000 per mm3, respectively. The overall glia/neuron ratio is 0.49."

If the stimuli are presented very briefly, eye movements are not possible. The time during which the after-image of the stimulus is available for inspection is terminated by presentation of a masking pattern. We show here that in these conditions a small pattern is easily detected against a background made up of many others, only if this target pattern differs from the background patterns in certain local features. In this case the detectability of the target is almost independent of the number of background elements, suggesting that a parallel process is operating. Detection of patterns not differing from their backgrounds in such features requires focal attention which is a serial process. The aperture of this attention is scaled to minimize the number of shifts of attention required."

Contrary to the idea that thalamic connections with the reticular nucleus are not delimited sharply between nuclei associated with the same modality, our results show a distinct laminar segregation of the projections from the GLd and pulvinar nuclei. The GLd is connected reciprocally with the lateral 2/3 of the caudal part of the reticular nucleus, and the striate cortex sends projections to the same lateral tier. Both sets of projections are organized topographically, lines of projection taking the form of slender elongated strips that run from caudo\u2010dorsal to rostro\u2010ventral within the nucleus. The pulvinar nucleus, which projects to several areas of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, including the striate cortex, is connected reciprocally with the medial 1/3 of the caudal part of the reticular nucleus. Every injection into the pulvinar nucleus labelled a wide area of the medial tier, with no indication of visuotopic organization. The projections from the middle temporal area, one of the principal targets of the pulvinar nucleus, also terminate only in the medial tier of the visual sector. And we would expect that, in general, a thalamic nucleus and its cortical target would project to the same part of the reticular nucleus. The case of the striate area is an exception but only in the sense that it projects to the pulvinar nucleus as well as GLd. Thus an injection into a single locus in area 17 produces two parallel strips in the visual sector of the reticular nucleus, but both are in the lateral tier. We propose that each strip arises from a separate population of cells with cortical layer VI, one with an allegiance to the GLd and the other to the pulvinar nucleus."

Copyright 1983 by tbe American Psychological Association. Adapted by permission.) the visual field, but that it did so at a constant velocity of approximately 8 msec per degree of visual angle. Tsal reasoned that if the attentional focus did traverse the visual field, the time required for the focus to move from a central fixation point along the horizontal meridian to a target should vary directly with the target's eccentricity. Thus, if a precue designating target location preceded the target by various stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs), the resulting RT -SOA functions should approach asymptote at different SOA levels for targets at 4 0 , 8 0 , and 12 eccentricity. The differences between the SOA values at which these three functions becameasymptotic would then directly reflect the difference in traversal time of the attentional focus from one target location to the other.' In Tsal's (1983) experiments, subjects were given a choice reaction time task in which they discriminated the letter 0 from the letter X. The precue was a small dot that occurred slightly peripheral to the subsequent target locations at SOAs of 50, 83, 116, 150, and 183 msec. Figure I is from Tsal's Experiment I and shows the RT-SOA functions for targets located at 4 0 , and 12 eccentricity. The asymptotes for these functions were"

After intracortical infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (DL-APV) for one day, iontophoretic responses to NMDA, to kainate, and to quisqualate revealed a receptor blockade specific to NMDA receptors and extending several millimeters from the cannula. In this region, neuronal responses to visual stimulation were profoundly suppressed, in a manner strongly correlated with the degree of NMDA receptor blockade. Neither NMDA receptor blockade nor activity suppression was caused by the inactive stereoisomer L-APV. Hence, we conclude that NMDA receptors make a major contribution to normal excitatory transmission in adult visual cortex."

This compulation can be implemented in a parallel network of neuron-like processors, but the network has a tendency to make errors of a peculiar kind: When presented with several shapes it sometimes perceives one shape in the position of another. The parameters can be carefully tuned to avoid these \"illusory conjunctions\" in normal circumstances, but they reappear if the visual input is replaced by a random mask before the network has settled down. Treisman and Schmidt (1982) have shown that people make similar errors."

In one experimental session, the attention-demanding displays were presented in the left visual field and the nonattention displays were presented in the right visual field. In a second session, the sides of the displays were reversed. Analysis of the scans indicated that, averaged across the 2 sessions, the pulvinar showed greater glucose uptake when it was contralateral to the display of the selective attention task than when it was contralateral to the display of the nonattention task. The pattern of the data indicated that the degree of the attention task effect on pulvinar glucose uptake may differ between the hemispheres. In view of known connections between the pulvinar and cortical areas that mediate object identification, the present finding suggests that the pulvinar operates interactively with these cortical structures when an identification process demands selective attention."

First, there is the problem of variable illumination, which can be addressed by working with relatively stable features such as intensity edges rather than the raw intensity images1,2. Second, there is the problem of the initially unknown pose of the object relative to the viewer. In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made about the viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object from such a viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual image3\u20137. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself a difficult problem8,9. To address this problem in computational vision, we have developed a scheme, based on the theory of approximation of multivariate functions, that learns from a small set of perspective views a function mapping any viewpoint to a standard view. A network equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize' the object on which it was trained from any viewpoint."

Performance for same-name, different-examplar images was worse than for identical images, indicating that not only was there priming from block one to block two, but that some of the priming was visual, rather than purely verbal or conceptual. These results provide evidence for complete translational and reflectional invariance in the representation of objects for purposes of visual recognition. Explicit recognition memory for position and orientation was above chance, suggesting that the representation of objects for recognition is independent of the representations of the location and left\u2014right orientation of objects in space."

In the first task, oppositely rotating luminance and color gratings were superimposed. Because of masking from the color grating, the bars of the luminance grating were not visible; nevertheless, their motion was visible and it determined the perceived direction of the stimulus rotation. On the other hand, the bars of the color grating were visible but they could only be seen to move (in the opposite direction to the overall stimulus rotation) when they were tracked with attention. In a second task, the perceived velocity of a color grating, typically slow at equiluminance, speeded up when individual bars were attentively tracked. These findings demonstrate two independent motion processes: one that is \"low-level\" or automatic in that it signals motion even in the absence of attention to the stimulus, and one that is mediated by attention to visible features and provides accurate velocity judgments independently of the features being tracked."

A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

A central arrow cued the most likely target location. The direction of attention was inferred from reaction times to expected, unexpected, and neutral locations. The development of a spatial attentional set with time was examined by presenting target probes at varying times after the cue. There were no effects of distance on the time course of the attentional set. Reaction times for far locations were slower than for near, but the effects of attention were evident by 150 msec in both cases. Spatial attention does not shift with a characteristic, fixed velocity. Rather, velocity is proportional to distance, resulting in a movement time that is invariant over the distances tested."

The act can be viewed in terms of three internal mental operations: disengagement of attention from its current focus, moving attention to the target, and engagement of the target. Our results show that damage to the parietal lobe produces a deficit in the disengage operation when the target is contralateral to the lesion. Effects may also be found on engagement with the target. The effects of brain injury on disengagement of attention seem to be unique to the parietal lobe and do not appear to occur with our frontal, midbrain, and temporal control series. These results confirm the close connection between parietal lobes and selective attention suggested by single cell recording. They indicate more specifically the role that parietal function has on attention and suggest one mechanism of the effects of parietal lesions reported in clinical neurology."

We show that within generally accepted ranges, inhibition at the AIS cannot completely prevent action potential discharge: only small amounts of excitatory synaptic current can be inhibited. Moderate amounts of excitatory current always result in action potential discharge, despite AIS inhibition. Inhibition of the somadendrite by basket cells enhances the effect of AIS inhibition and vice versa. Thus the axoaxonic cells may act synergistically with basket cells: the AIS inhibition increases the threshold for action potential discharge, the basket cells then control the suprathreshold discharge."

Our results indicate that dorsal V1 (representing the inferior contralateral visual quadrant) consistently projects in topographically organized fashion to V3 in the lunate and parietooccipital sulci as well as to the middle temporal area (MT) and dorsal V2. In contrast, ventral V1 (representing the superior contralateral quadrant) projects only to MT and ventral V2. A corresponding dorsoventral asymmetry in myeloarchitecture supports the idea that V3 is an area that is restricted to dorsal extrastriate cortex and lacks a complete representation of the visual field. The average surface area of myeloarchitectonically identified V3 was 89 mm2. Additional information was obtained concerning the laminar distribution of connections from V1 to V2 and V3, the patchiness of these projections, and the consistency of projections to other extrastriate areas, including V4 and V3A."

In some of these cells the ionic conductances responsible for their excitability also endow them with autorhythmic electrical oscillatory properties. Chemical or electrical synaptic contacts between these neurons often result in network oscillations. In such networks, autorhythmic neurons may act as true oscillators (as pacemakers) or as resonators (responding preferentially to certain firing frequencies). Oscillations and resonance in the CNS are proposed to have diverse functional roles, such as (i) determining global functional states (for example, sleep-wakefulness or attention), (ii) timing in motor coordination, and (iii) specifying connectivity during development. Also, oscillation, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuits, may be related to certain neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review proposes that the autorhythmic electrical properties of central neurons and their connectivity form the basis for an intrinsic functional coordinate system that provides internal context to sensory input."

                "text": "This study compares the performance (percent correct responses and reaction times) of three unoperated control monkeys with the postoperative performance of eight monkeys with pulvinar lesions, either inferior pulvinar or medial and lateral pulvinar, on a tachistoscopically presented visual pattern-discrimination task highly demanding of attention. To further emphasize and assess the attentional factor in visual pattern discrimination, all monkeys who attained criterion performance (90% correct response on three consecutive sessions of 100 trials each) were tested for the effects of visually distracting interference stimuli added to the original discriminative stimuli. In addition, retention of postoperatively learned discriminations was tested after a 6-wk interval withou training and compared with the performance of control monkeys. Four monkeys with only inferior pulvinar lesions and one monkey with inferior pulvinar plus medial and lateral pulvinar lesions were markedly impaired in the postoperative learning of a visual pattern discrimination. Three of these monkeys failed to acquire criterion perfromance in 9,000 or more training trials, while two learned to ceiterion level only after prolonged training (7,400 and 6,900 trials). In contrast, monkeys with medial and lateral pulvinar lesions showed no deficit in learning ability compared to unoperated control monkeys. Furthermore, the performance of the two monkeys with inferior pulvinar lesions, who attained the criterion level of learning only with difficulty, was further impaired by the addition of distracting interference stimuli, where the performance of monkeys with medial and lateral pulvinar lesions as well as the control monkeys was only temporarily disrupted by this procedure. None of the monkeys with pulvinar lesions, who were tested for retention of the postoperatively learned discrimination, showed appreciable deficits in comparison to control monkeys. All monkeys, including controls and those uith pulvinar lesions who were able to learn the visual pattern discrimination, showed a common pattern of reaction time (RT) change during the course of the learning; that is, RT was low during change-level performance, increased during learning, and decreased once criterion performance was achieved. Reaction times of monkeys with inferior pulvinar lesions tended to be longer than for controls or for those with medial and lateral pulvinar lesions. These results provide the first behavior evidence that the inferior pulvinar of monkeys is involved in visual pattern discrimination and add further support to the concept of a second visual system in which the inferior pulvinar plays a role. The attentional aspects of the visual pattern-discrimination task employed in this study and the additional effects obtained with distracting stimuli suggest that the impairments arising from inferior pulvinar lesions may be dependent in part on visual attentional factors."

Responses of single cells were recorded in area V4 of macaque monkey to three classes of periodic stimuli that are based on spatial derivative operators: polar (concentric and radial), hyperbolic, and conventional sinusoidal (Cartesian) gratings. Of 118 cells tested, 16 percent responded significantly more to polar or hyperbolic (non-Cartesian) gratings than to Cartesian gratings and only 8 percent showed a significant preference for Cartesian gratings. Among cells selective for non-Cartesian gratings, those that preferred concentric gratings were most common. Cells selective for non-Cartesian gratings may constitute an important intermediate stage in pattern recognition and the representation of surface shape."

The targets were preceded by a cue, and the time interval between the cue and the target (stimulus-onset asynchrony; SOA) was varied. For each peripheral distance, the reaction time function initially declined as SOA was increased and then reached asymptote. The further the target from fixation, the longer the SOA at which the function reached asymptote. The asymptotic SOA values were taken as a measure of the time it takes attention to reach a given target. Comparisons of these values for the three peripheral distances permitted estimating the velocity of attention movements. These measurements suggest that when summoned by a peripheral cue, attention travels through space at a constant velocity of about 1 degree per 8 msec."
