For CTR prediction model, it is necessary to capture the latent user interest behind the user behavior data. Besides, considering the changing of the external environment and the internal cognition, user interest evolves over time dynamically. There are several CTR prediction methods for interest modeling, while most of them regard the representation of behavior as the interest directly, and lack specially modeling for latent interest behind the concrete behavior. Moreover, little work considers the changing trend of the interest. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Deep Interest Evolution Network (DIEN), for CTR prediction. Specifically, we design interest extractor layer to capture temporal interests from history behavior sequence. At this layer, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise interest extracting at each step. As user interests are diverse, especially in the e-commerce system, we propose interest evolving layer to capture interest evolving process that is relative to the target item. At interest evolving layer, attention mechanism is embedded into the sequential structure novelly, and the effects of relative interests are strengthened during interest evolution. In the experiments on both public and industrial datasets, DIEN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. Notably, DIEN has been deployed in the display advertisement system of Taobao, and obtained 20.7% improvement on CTR."

Previous work only considers the user's sequential behavior in the current session, whereas the user's main purpose in the current session is not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a novel neural networks framework, i.e., Neural Attentive Recommendation Machine (NARM), to tackle this problem. Specifically, we explore a hybrid encoder with an attention mechanism to model the user's sequential behavior and capture the user's main purpose in the current session, which are combined as a unified session representation later. We then compute the recommendation scores for each candidate item with a bi-linear matching scheme based on this unified session representation. We train NARM by jointly learning the item and session representations as well as their matchings. We carried out extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. Our experimental results show that NARM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both datasets. Furthermore, we also find that NARM achieves a significant improvement on long sessions, which demonstrates its advantages in modeling the user's sequential behavior and main purpose simultaneously."

Recently, session-based recommendationsare becoming popular to explore the temporal characteristics of customers' interactive behaviors. However, existing works mainly exploit the short-term behaviors without fully taking the customers' long-term stable preferences and evolutions into account. In this paper, we propose a novel Behavior-Intensive Neural Network (BINN) for next-item recommendation by incorporating both users' historical stable preferences and present consumption motivations. Specifically, BINN contains two main components, i.e., Neural Item Embedding, and Discriminative Behaviors Learning. Firstly, a novel item embedding method based on user interactions is developed for obtaining an unified representation for each item. Then, with the embedded items and the interactive behaviors over item sequences, BINN discriminatively learns the historical preferences and present motivations of the target users. Thus, BINN could better perform recommendations of the next items for the target users. Finally, for evaluating the performances of BINN, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, i.e., Tianchi and JD. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of BINN compared with several state-of-the-art methods."

Methods that rely on user profiles -- such as matrix factorization -- perform very poorly in this setting, thus item-to-item recommendations are used most of the time. However the items typically have rich feature representations such as pictures and text descriptions that can be used to model the sessions. Here we investigate how these features can be exploited in Recurrent Neural Network based session models using deep learning. We show that obvious approaches do not leverage these data sources. We thus introduce a number of parallel RNN (p-RNN) architectures to model sessions based on the clicks and the features (images and text) of the clicked items. We also propose alternative training strategies for p-RNNs that suit them better than standard training. We show that p-RNN architectures with proper training have significant performance improvements over feature-less session models while all session-based models outperform the item-to-item type baseline."

                "text": "Sequential dynamics are a key feature of many modern recommender systems, which seek to capture the 'context' of users' activities on the basis of actions they have performed recently. To capture such patterns, two approaches have proliferated: Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Markov Chains assume that a user's next action can be predicted on the basis of just their last (or last few) actions, while RNNs in principle allow for longer-term semantics to be uncovered. Generally speaking, MC-based methods perform best in extremely sparse datasets, where model parsimony is critical, while RNNs perform better in denser datasets where higher model complexity is affordable. The goal of our work is to balance these two goals, by proposing a self-attention based sequential model (SASRec) that allows us to capture long-term semantics (like an RNN), but, using an attention mechanism, makes its predictions based on relatively few actions (like an MC). At each time step, SASRec seeks to identify which items are 'relevant' from a user's action history, and use them to predict the next item. Extensive empirical studies show that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models (including MC/CNN/RNN-based approaches) on both sparse and dense datasets. Moreover, the model is an order of magnitude more efficient than comparable CNN/RNN-based models. Visualizations on attention weights also show how our model adaptively handles datasets with various density, and uncovers meaningful patterns in activity sequences."

Recent advances in recurrent neural networks have led to promising approaches to solving this problem, with long short-term memory model proving effective in capturing users' general interests from previous clicks. However, none of the existing approaches explicitly take the effects of users' current actions on their next moves into account. In this study, we argue that a long-term memory model may be insufficient for modeling long sessions that usually contain user interests drift caused by unintended clicks. A novel short-term attention/memory priority model is proposed as a remedy, which is capable of capturing users' general interests from the long-term memory of a session context, whilst taking into account users' current interests from the short-term memory of the last-clicks. The validity and efficacy of the proposed attention mechanism is extensively evaluated on three benchmark data sets from the RecSys Challenge 2015 and CIKM Cup 2016. The numerical results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in all the tests."

A common way to deal with the user modeling problem is to manually extract all kinds of aggregated features over the heterogeneous behaviors, which may fail to fully represent the data itself due to limited human instinct. Recent works usually use RNN-based methods to give an overall embedding of a behavior sequence, which then could be exploited by the downstream applications. However, this can only preserve very limited information, or aggregated memories of a person. When a downstream application requires to facilitate the modeled user features, it may lose the integrity of the specific highly correlated behavior of the user, and introduce noises derived from unrelated behaviors. This paper proposes an attention based user behavior modeling framework called ATRank, which we mainly use for recommendation tasks. Heterogeneous user behaviors are considered in our model that we project all types of behaviors into multiple latent semantic spaces, where influence can be made among the behaviors via self-attention. Downstream applications then can use the user behavior vectors via vanilla attention. Experiments show that ATRank can achieve better performance and faster training process. We further explore ATRank to use one unified model to predict different types of user behaviors at the same time, showing a comparable performance with the highly optimized individual models.\n \n"

The idea is to embed a sequence of recent items into an \u00bbimage\u00bb in the time and latent spaces and learn sequential patterns as local features of the image using convolutional filters.

Real-life recommender systems often face the problem of having to base recommendations only on short session-based data (e.g. a small sportsware website) instead of long user histories (as in the case of Netflix). In this situation the frequently praised matrix factorization approaches are not accurate. This problem is usually overcome in practice by resorting to item-to-item recommendations, i.e. recommending similar items. We argue that by modeling the whole session, more accurate recommendations can be provided. We therefore propose an RNN-based approach for session-based recommendations. Our approach also considers practical aspects of the task and introduces several modifications to classic RNNs such as a ranking loss function that make it more viable for this specific problem. Experimental results on two data-sets show marked improvements over widely used approaches."

Despite great progress, existing methods seem to have a strong bias towards low- or high-order interactions, or require expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we show that it is possible to derive an end-to-end learning model that emphasizes both low- and high-order feature interactions. The proposed model, DeepFM, combines the power of factorization machines for recommendation and deep learning for feature learning in a new neural network architecture. Compared to the latest Wide & Deep model from Google, DeepFM has a shared input to its \"wide\" and \"deep\" parts, with no need of feature engineering besides raw features. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DeepFM over the existing models for CTR prediction, on both benchmark data and commercial data."

While in many session-based recommendation domains user identifiers are hard to come by, there are also domains in which user profiles are readily available. We propose a seamless way to personalize RNN models with cross-session information transfer and devise a Hierarchical RNN model that relays end evolves latent hidden states of the RNNs across user sessions. Results on two industry datasets show large improvements over the session-only RNNs."

However, the process is nontrivial and often requires manual feature engineering or exhaustive searching. DNNs are able to automatically learn feature interactions; however, they generate all the interactions implicitly, and are not necessarily efficient in learning all types of cross features. In this paper, we propose the Deep & Cross Network (DCN) which keeps the benefits of a DNN model, and beyond that, it introduces a novel cross network that is more efficient in learning certain bounded-degree feature interactions. In particular, DCN explicitly applies feature crossing at each layer, requires no manual feature engineering, and adds negligible extra complexity to the DNN model. Our experimental results have demonstrated its superiority over the state-of-art algorithms on the CTR prediction dataset and dense classification dataset, in terms of both model accuracy and memory usage."

                "text": "Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs. Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide & Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in TensorFlow."

However, despite sharing some common characteristics a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist in this space. Given a large difference in content that needs to be ranked, personalized and recommended, each marketplace has a somewhat unique challenge. Correspondingly, at Airbnb, a short-term rental marketplace, search and recommendation problems are quite unique, being a two-sided marketplace in which one needs to optimize for host and guest preferences, in a world where a user rarely consumes the same item twice and one listing can accept only one guest for a certain set of dates. In this paper we describe Listing and User Embedding techniques we developed and deployed for purposes of Real-time Personalization in Search Ranking and Similar Listing Recommendations, two channels that drive 99% of conversions. The embedding models were specifically tailored for Airbnb marketplace, and are able to capture guest's short-term and long-term interests, delivering effective home listing recommendations. We conducted rigorous offline testing of the embedding models, followed by successful online tests before fully deploying them into production."

Since it was first held ten years ago, RecSys has grown to become the leading conference for the presentation and discussion of recommender systems research, bringing together the world's leading recommender systems researchers and e-commerce companies. \n \nThe program for RecSys 2016 reflects the growth of the Recommender Systems community. For the second time in the history of RecSys we will offer two parallel tracks during the three days of the main conference with a record breaking 112 contributions including 51 technical papers, 9 Past, Present, and Future papers, 15 industry papers, four tutorials, three keynotes, and 30 demos and posters. We again offer an extensive pre-conference program with nine workshops, the RecSys Challenge and a doctoral symposium. \n \nThe technical program for RecSys 2016 drew upon a record 294 total submissions. To celebrate the tenth year of the conference, the program features a new track reflecting on past, present, and future research in the field of recommender systems. Papers in this track consider a broad perspective on how the field has evolved and the challenges and directions that lie ahead. The review process for all tracks was highly selective. In the main program, 29 long papers were accepted out of 159 submissions (18.2% acceptance rate), 22 out of 110 short papers (20% acceptance rate), and 9 out of 25 Past, Present and Future paper submissions (36% acceptance rate). Prominent topics covered by these papers include human factors, social aspects, context awareness, cold start, novelty and diversity, and core algorithmic research (matrix factorization, deep learning, probabilistic approaches, etc.). \n \nBuilding on the tradition established by previous years, RecSys 2016 features a strong focus on significant real-world challenges facing industrial practitioners and practical solutions to those challenges. The three industry sessions feature a rich set of talks from Mendeley, Meetup, Bloomberg, Foursquare, Spotify, Netflix, Pandora, Stitch Fix, Expedia, Nara Logics, GraphSQL, Retail Rocket, Quora, Google and Pinterest. A wide range of domains are represented in these sessions including publishing, news, Q & A, events, music, movies, television, fashion, apps and games."

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data."

We are pleased to present the 26th edition of CIKM on 6-10 November, 2017, at the Pan Pacific Singapore hotel, with the special theme of Smart Cities, Smart Nations. \n \nThis year our attendees will enjoy four keynote speakers: Rajeev Rastogi (Amazon), Qiang Yang (HKUST), Rada Mihalcea (Michigan), and K Ananth Krishnan (Tata Consultancy Services). In 6-7 parallel sessions, our program includes presentations of 171 full research papers, 119 short research papers, and 30 demonstrations of new research advances. The program's focus this year can be seen at a glance in the word cloud at right, constructed from the titles of all accepted research papers. Also on offer are eight tutorials on timely research topics, and six collocated workshops on topics ranging from history to transportation, biomedicine to bias. \n \nWe are excited about our greatly expanded data analytics competition this year, the CIKM AnalytiCup. During the past nine months, over 1500 teams from all over the world have vied to win over $60,000 in AnalytiCup prizes and travel money by solving real-world analytics problems posed by our corporate sponsors Alibaba/Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau, DataSpark, and Lazada. A fourth competition, a weekend-long hackathon sponsored by DHL, takes place immediately before the conference. The finalists from all four competitions come together on 6 November for a final showdown in front of corporate judges. Solution summaries from finalist teams in the first three competitions can be found in these proceedings. \n \nAlso new this year are several other events aimed directly at practitioners. During the main conference, we are offering hands-on tutorials on the hot topics of scalable deep learning and scalable data science. The Case Studies track, intended to highlight the experiences and lessons learned by early adopters, debuts this year with 23 studies of technology adoption in interesting applications. And immediately before the main conference, CIKMconnect brings together students and industry for posters, technical discussions, recruiting events, and networking. \n \nIt takes a village to produce a major conference! Our program committee chairs, senior PC and PC members valiantly and gracefully handled a record total number of submissions: 855 full research papers, 419 short research papers, 80 demos, and 103 case studies. Each submission was reviewed by three program committee members, each a recognized expert in the field, and an independent committee selected the full paper awards recipients."

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition."

First, dataset and knowledge will be defined and elucidated as under DMKD. DMKD is a discovery process with different hierarchies, granularities, and/or scales. For a set of concepts that may be best understood if being viewed and explained from various perspectives, the chapter starts with a definition followed by a table explaining DMKD from different views (Sect. 5.1). The evolution of DMKD is then briefly tracked from the rapid advance in massive data to the birth of DMKD (Sect. 5.2). Some mathematical foundations are given in Sect. 5.3, i.e. probability theory, statistics, fuzzy set, rough set, data fields, and cloud models. Section 5.4 introduces some usable DMKD techniques. DMKD is used to discover a set of rules and exceptions with association, classification, clustering, prediction, discrimination, and exception detection. In Sects. 5.5 and 5.6, data warehouses and decision support systems are given. The first one mentioned is one of the data sources for DMKD, and DMKD is a new technique to assist the latter with a task. Finally, trends and perspectives are summarized and forecasted into two promising fields, web mining and spatial data mining (Sect. 5.7)."

                "text": "Lecture Notes for the MSc/DTC module. The brain is a complex computing machine which has evolved to give the ttest output to a given input. Neural computation has as goal to describe the function of the nervous system in mathematical and computational terms. By analysing or simulating the resulting equations, one can better understand its function, research how changes in parameters would eect the function, and try to mimic the nervous system in hardware or software implementations. Neural Computation is a bit like physics, that has been successful in describing numerous physical phenomena. However, approaches developed in those elds not always work for neural computation, because: 1. Physical systems are best studied in reduced, simplied circumstances, but the nervous system is hard to study in isolation. Neurons require a narrow range of operating conditions (temperature, oxygen, presence of other neurons, ion concentrations, ...) under which they work as they should. These conditions are hard to reproduce outside the body. Secondly, the neurons form a highly interconnected network. The function of the nervous systems depends on this connectivity and interaction, by trying to isolate the components, you are likely to alter the function. 2. It is not clear how much detail one needs to describe the computations in the brain. In these lectures we shall see various description levels. 3. Neural signals and neural connectivity are hard to measure, especially, if disturbance and damage to the nervous system is to be kept minimal. Perhaps Neural Computation has more in common with trying to gure out how a complicated machine, such as a computer or car works. Knowledge of the basic physics helps, but is not sucient. Luckily there are factors which perhaps make understanding the brain easier than understanding an arbitrary complicated machine: 1. There is a high degree of conservation across species. This means that animal studies can be used to gain information about the human brain. Furthermore, study of, say, the visual system might help to understand the auditory system. 2. The nervous system is able to develop by combining on one hand a only limited amount of genetic information and, on the other hand, the input it receives. Therefore it might be possible to nd the organising principles and develop a brain from there. This would be easier than guring out the complete 'wiring diagram'. 3. The nervous system is exible and robust, neurons die everyday. This stands \u2026"

Existing recommendation algorithms -- including both shallow and deep approaches -- usually embed a user\u00bbs historical records into a single latent vector/representation, which may have lost the per item- or feature-level correlations between a user\u00bbs historical records and future interests. In this paper, we aim to express, store, and manipulate users\u00bb historical records in a more explicit, dynamic, and effective manner. To do so, we introduce the memory mechanism to recommender systems. Specifically, we design a memory-augmented neural network (MANN) integrated with the insights of collaborative filtering for recommendation. By leveraging the external memory matrix in MANN, we store and update users\u00bb historical records explicitly, which enhances the expressiveness of the model. We further adapt our framework to both item- and feature-level versions, and design the corresponding memory reading/writing operations according to the nature of personalized recommendation scenarios. Compared with state-of-the-art methods that consider users\u00bb sequential behavior for recommendation, e.g., sequential recommenders with recurrent neural networks (RNN) or Markov chains, our method achieves significantly and consistently better performance on four real-world datasets. Moreover, experimental analyses show that our method is able to extract the intuitive patterns of how users\u00bb future actions are affected by previous behaviors."

Despite effectiveness, FM can be hindered by its modelling of all feature interactions with the same weight, as not all feature interactions are equally useful and predictive. For example, the interactions with useless features may even introduce noises and adversely degrade the performance. In this work, we improve FM by discriminating the importance of different feature interactions. We propose a novel model named Attentional Factorization Machine (AFM), which learns the importance of each feature interaction from data via a neural attention network. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AFM. Empirically, it is shown on regression task AFM betters FM with a $8.6\\%$ relative improvement, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning methods Wide&Deep and DeepCross with a much simpler structure and fewer model parameters. Our implementation of AFM is publicly available at: this https URL"
